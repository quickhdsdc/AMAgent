    "content": "Multiple studies have been conducted for characterization and measurement of AM-ed surface topography of various building directions.Strano et al.[1] proposed a mathematical model to predict surface roughness of AM-ed flat surface at different slope angles considering both stair effect and partially bonded particles effect.The predicted surface roughness (Ra) was found to be in good agreement with experiments except for the $0 ^ { \\circ }$ slope angle sample.Covarrubias and Eshraghi [2] experimentally studied the effect of build angle on surface roughness and surface texture in Nickel alloy IN718 fabricated by SLM. They concluded that the maximum surface roughness appeared at $\\boldsymbol { 1 5 ^ { \\circ } }$ build angle (the angle between the measured surface and horizontal plane） and minimum surface roughness occurred at $0 ^ { \\circ }$ build angle (measured surface parallel to horizontal plane).Besides,they found the surface roughness for surfaces slope angles of $\\boldsymbol { 1 5 ^ { \\circ } }$ $3 0 ^ { \\circ }$ $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ ${ { 6 0 } ^ { \\circ } }$ and $7 5 ^ { \\circ }$ matched well with those theoretically calculated considering stair effect.Alrbaey et al.[3] employed Renishaw SLM 125 to print $3 1 6 \\mathrm { L }$ samples with different inclined angle.However, their measurement results showed a linear relationship between inclined angle and surface roughness (Ra) while the maximum surface roughness Ra appeared at $0 ^ { \\circ }$ inclined angle.The authors attributed the linear relationship to stair effects,which indicated the effect of partially bonded particles was not predominant. In the work contributed by Urlea and Brailovski [4],EOS M280 metal printer was employed to fabricate Ti-6Al-4V alloy components.

It should be noted that heat treatment was conducted for the above-mentioned samples.Snyder et al.[5] studied the effect of building direction on internal surface roughness as well as accuracy. They employed computed tomography scan (CTscan),a non-destructive measurement method,to characterize the surface roughness and accuracy.Though the resolution was not high enough,surface roughness and accuracy data could still be acquired and distinguished.It was found that building in the vertical direction resulted in the best surface roughness Ra $8 . 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and best runout, concentricity,and circularity. Investigations have been done to improve surface roughness by optimizing process parameters to improve surface roughness in DMLS [6].However,it is not always possible to optimize scan speed,laser power,hatch distances,etc.to minimize surface roughness due to shape limitations,density and strength issues.The SLM-ed surface has to undergo post-processing. Over the years,multiple methods have been used to improve surface finish of parts produced by SLM.",

    "content": "To some extent,improving surface finish of parts generated by SLM can be categorized as freeform surface and intricate internal surfaces finishing problem,for example internal channel or lattice structure. Techniques which could be applied for finishing freeform surfaces have been adopted to process parts produced by SLM, such as laser remelting which is also referred to as laser polishing [3],electropolishing [7], machining [8] and abrasive finishing [9].Laser remelting is a surface treatment technique employed during or after SLM to modify the surface microstructure and roughness.Alrbaey et al.[3] claimed an $8 0 \\%$ improvement in surface roughness and almost $1 0 0 \\%$ density of remelted zone without external and internal porosities on the treated surface.Yasa and Kruth [1O] reported an experimental study on the effect of laser re-melting on stainless steel $3 1 6 \\mathrm { L }$ workpiece fabricated by SLM. They concluded that though longer production time is needed, the porosity of part generated by SLM decreased from $0 . 7 7 \\%$ to $0 . 0 3 6 \\%$ and surface roughness reduced from $1 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $1 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .Ukar,et al. [11] investigated the application of laser polishing on DIN 1.2379 tool steel. An average surface roughness below $0 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ Ra was achieved while a softened layer of $2 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ was formed after laser polishing. Lamikiz, et al.[l2] also presented their study on laser polishing of sintered AISI 420 stainless steel. The final roughness reached Ra $1 . 2 \\mathrm { - } 1 . 3 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ from initial Ra $7 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .Metallurgical analysis showed that the laser polished surface is more homogeneous than the initial sintered material. It was also reported that stair effect of SLM parts can be eliminated with the optimized laser polishing parameters when the surrounding powder particles were blown away [13].",

    "content": " However, a soft layer of hundreds of micrometers induced by laser re-melting on the AM-ed surface is undesirable as a mold surface which needs to be hardened (heat affected zone,HAZ,in laser remelting/polishing). Shot peening as another important surface treatment technique has also been widely used for form correction as well as hardening of the AM-ed metal surface.In the process, compressive residual stresses are induced in the surface layer by bombarding high-velocity particles.However,the use of laser polishing and shot peening is subject to the complexity of the surface produced and target form accuracy and roughness. In many cases, the surfaces are inaccessible and untreatable with the above mentioned methods. Recently, Yung et al.[14] developed a layered laser polishing method to polish complex surface such as convex surface,concave surface and slant surface.In this layered laser polishing method, the targeted surface was divided by layers and the defocusing distance of the laser was adjusted accordingly. Recently, Ghosh et al.[15] proposed layer-by-layer combination of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and laser machining to fabricate complex parts for the sake of minimizing side-wall roughness. The surface roughness $\\left( \\mathbb { R } \\mathbf { q } \\right)$ on side wall was greatly improved from $3 1 ~ \\pm ~ 8 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $0 . 3 7 ~ \\pm ~ 0 . 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ though submicrometer laser-induced periodic surface structures appeared in the finished surface. Urlea and Brailovski [4] employed electropolishing to process Ti-6Al-4V alloy components produced by SLM with several inclined angles and the surface roughness Ra could be reduced to a uniform Ra of $1 { - } 3 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ within $3 0 \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ regardless of the fact that the initial surface roughness Ra varies from $4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ 0 $\\mathrm { ~ \\textit ~ { ~ O ~ } ~ } ^ { \\circ }$ inclined angle, upskin) to $2 3 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ $( 1 3 5 ^ { \\circ }$ ,downskin).",

Alrbaey et al.[7] electropolished the selective laser melted $3 1 6 \\mathrm { L }$ stainless steel samples pretreated by laser remelting.In their study, stair effect on surface finish was eliminated by laser remelting and surface roughness Ra was improved to $1 . 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .The surface roughness Ra was further improved to below $0 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ within $3 0 { \\mathrm { - } } 6 0 \\operatorname* { m i n }$ of electropolishing.Tyagi et al.[16] compared the performance of chemical polishing and electropolishing on SLS $3 1 6 \\mathrm { L }$ workpiece regarding surface roughness and accessbility. They found that electropolishing could achieve better surface finish than chemical polishing; however,it could not polish internal surface without a counter electrode inserted. On the other hand,chemical polishing could effectively reduce surface roughness of the external and internal surface simultaneously. Mohammadian et al.[17] developed a combined chemical-abrasive flow polishing method for Inconel 625 samples generated by SLM. Surface roughness Ra on a $\\boldsymbol { 1 5 ^ { \\circ } }$ inclination surface was improved by $4 3 \\%$ after 1- h finishing. However, those chemical/electrochemical based finishing methods encounter chemical hazards and are generally not environmentally friendly.Li et al.[9] investigated the grindability of sintered nickel-base superalloy FGH96 and found the roughness of ground surface is most sensitive to depth of cut and least sensitive to the abrasive wheel speed. By developing porous metal-bonded cubic boron nitride (CBN) grinding wheels, Zhao etal.[18] achieved lower ground surface hardness and higher material removal rate compared with conventional vitrified wheel.However, the wear and pullout of abrasive grain may shorten the grinding wheel life,especially in high speed grinding [19].

The scope of the paper is to investigate the polishability of selective laser melted parts with different slope angles by MAF,a nonconventional and flexible finishing technique.As a fundamental study on MAF of surfaces generated by SLM,7 representative surfaces with different slope angles were fabricated by an EOS M290 Metal 3D Printer to simulate surfaces from complex components. Surface roughness and topography were characterized,and effect of slope angle was investigated. Material removal rate for the developed polishing process was modelled by considering the effect of initial surface roughness. Dimensional accuracy is not the focus of this paper since it is mainly determined by the printing process but the main function of MAF is to reduce surface roughness rather than improve dimension accuracy.",

The surface of interest was the $2 0 \\mathrm { m m } \\times 2 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ upskin surface.The slope angle 0 was defined by the angle between the upskin surface and laser beam,e.g. for $0 ^ { \\circ }$ sample the upskin surface was parallel to the laser beam while for $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ sample the upskin surface was perpendicular to the laser beam.It should be noted that $0 ^ { \\circ }$ and $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ samples were printed in another batch and not shown in Fig.1.For each slope angle,6 identical samples were printed. Since the scope of the paper is to study the polishability of selective laser melted parts with different angles,the printing parameters were kept constant for all samples and those parameters were default parameters which resulted in the highest density and mechanical strength.These parameters are listed in Table 1. The chemical composition of EOS 17-4 PH stainless steel powderis presented in Table 2 and the morphology of the powder under scanning electron microscope (SEM) is shown in Fig.2.It should be noted that for samples with a slope angle larger than $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ ，support structure is essential. The support structure was printed by different parameters so that it could ensure the successful printing of the designed structures and could also be easily removed.Nevertheless,the existence of support structure in this research will not affect the targeted surfaces since they are under downskin surfaces.After printing, the samples were detached from the substrate without heat treatment.

    "content": "Due to its flexibility,magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) was employed to polish the samples generated by SLM.Fig.3(c) illustrates the working principle of the MAF involved in this paper.The workpiece was sandwiched between an upper magnet and a lower magnet. With this configuration,magnetic abrasives could form a stable polishing brush in the imposed magnetic field and a pressure was generated between the polishing brush and workpiece surface [22].The lower magnet and the workpiece were stationary while the upper magnet was subject to reciprocating motion with the magnet holder.As the magnet holder vibrated,a relative movement between the polishing brush and workpiece facilitated the mechanical material removal process.The magnetic flux density in the operating zone was simulated by a software package Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) and the parameters are listed in Table 3.It should be noted that permanent magnets with N50 grade were used in the simulation as it resembled the magnets used in the experiments.Fig.3(a) and (b) show the simulation results of magnetic flux density distribution without and with bottom magnet, respectively.It is seen that with bottom magnet,the magnetic flux density is concentrated more towards the workpiece,which results in stronger bonding force of magnetic abrasive particles in the polishing zone.The simulation results are consistent with the distribution of magnetic abrasive particles between the magnet and the workpiece as shown in Fig. 3(c, d).\n\n![](images/9f354f3372c27f98e2095f836de9c6e492a97a215893e7049fed9134efe27ee9.jpg)  \nFig.1.(a) Sample dimension and (b) as-printed samples with slope angles from $\\boldsymbol { 1 5 ^ { \\circ } }$ to $7 5 ^ { \\circ }$\n\n![](images/ed5b093faa49a13a4b3d951263978bfda538c304f1e16ee40ddc80e2250bdc20.jpg)  \nFig. 2.

In case of ${ { 6 0 } ^ { \\circ } }$ slope angle, $L _ { S }$ is only $6 9 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and is less than laser spot size of $8 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } .$ ，which means the molten pool can cover at least two steps.When slope angle increases to $7 5 ^ { \\circ }$ $L _ { S }$ reaches $1 4 9 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .In this case, $L _ { S }$ is much larger than both laser spot size $8 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and hatch distance of $9 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ 、Thus,the molten pool of subsequent layers will not overlap.The percentage of unmolten particles also reduces and improvement in surface finish is observed.Another important effect of these parameters is the degree to which the unmolten particles are fused with the layers.As the slope angle increases,the partially molten particles are fused effectively up to ${ { 6 0 } ^ { \\circ } }$ .As the slope angle increases to $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ ,the stair effect is not applicable and the top surface of $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ sample benefits from multiple laser remelting processes as most of the partially bonded particles are significantly fused, which results in the best surface roughness at $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ .

Seven samples with various slope angles were printed and their surface were systematically characterized regarding surface roughness and topography. Magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) was developed to polish the as-printed surfaces.The surface roughness evolution and material removal were well recorded and analysed.Besides,the material removal rate of MAF process was modelled. The following conclusions could be drawn:\n\n(1) The SLM strategy is a dominant factor for the initial surface roughness which features an increase with the slope angle till ${ { 6 0 } ^ { \\circ } }$ followed by a decrease due to larger step length leading to reduction of the percentage of unmolten particles;   \n(2) The developed magnetic abrasive finishing method can effectively remove most partially bonded particles and balling defects,which requires substantial mechanical work exerted on the material removal in a sizable volume rather than a simply polishing process to achieve a glossy surface;   \n(3) After magnetic abrasive finishing,a maximum decrease of $7 5 . 7 \\%$ in surface roughness Ra was achieved and the average reduction of $\\mathrm { R p }$ is almost twice as that of Rv;   \n(4)As the developed magnetic abrasive finishing method is not devised based on a deterministic material removal mechanism,small amplitudes of surface irregularities will be removed most effectively.\n\nThus, the surface roughness after finishing follows the similar trend found in the initial surface roughness of the as-built samples;",

    "content": "# ABSTRACT\nKeywords:   \nSelective laser melting   \nX-ray computed tomography   \nMechanical properties   \nMicromechanical-statistical modeling\n\nAdditive manufacturing (AM) is regarded as one of the breakthrough innovations since the 19th century,whose impact on the manufacturing world is recognized as the same with the impact of airplaneon the transportation industry [1].Selective laser melting (SLM),one of the most popular AM techniques for processng metalic materials,has demonstrated its great potentials in medical,aerospace and automotiveapplications.The SLM technique itself is a complex metallurgical process,involving multi-physics phenomenon in laser scanning, powder melting and bonding procedure.Such a process may introduce a variety of defects and flaws such as pores and cracks,significantly reducing the mechanical performance of the final products.In this paper,we present experimental studies and micromechanical modeling to investigate the efects of the internal pores on the mechanical properties of 316L stainless steel (SS316L）processed by the SLM technique.Specifically,the internal pore characteristics such as size,morphology,spatial distribution and porosity (defined as the total volume of the pores divided by the total volume of the material) of the SLMprocessed SS316L is experimentally characterized and correlated with the mechanical properties.More importantly,a micromechanical model taking into account the statistical pore characteristics from the XCT analysis is developed to predict the elastic properties of the SS316L product.The numerical prediction results show good agreement with two analytical models and the experimental characterization of the mechanical properties.The present study provides future designers a methodology in predicting the mechanical properties using the XCT analysis results,which is a promising possibility of saving the expensive cost on destructive testing.",

    "content": "Asa well-known additive manufacturing technique,selective laser melting (SLM) process has demonstrated growing applications in various industrial fields due to its capability of fabricating metallic parts with complex geometries and handling wide ranges of materials [1-4]. During the SLM process,a computer-controlled laser beam is implemented on a powder bed platform to selectively melt and bond a thin layer of the metallic powder into a designed slice of solid. Subsequently, additional layers of powder are applied on top of the previously created solid slice,solidified by the selective laser scanning and bonded to the processed layers such that the entire product is successively built in a layer-by-layer manner [5-7].\n\nDifferent from the conventional manufacturing methods,such a layer based manufacturing process gives rise to a higher risk of introducing inhomogeneities,in particular a variety of defects and flaw, which affect the mechanical behavior of the final products significantly.\n\nThe formation of the internal defects is directly related to the choices of process parameters like laser power, scanning speed and hatch distance. For example, insufficient laser power results in low energy input giving rise to unmolten powder particles [8].A fast scanning speed leads to balling effects generating pores or voids in the SLM parts [9-11]. Similarly,a large hatch distance induces the imperfect bonding between adjacent scanning tracks and layers [12].",

    "content": "As reported by an increasing number of recent literature,X-ray computed tomography (XCT) has been recognized as the most effective nondestructive testing method for inspecting the internal defects of products fabricated by additive manufacturing [13-15]. One significant advantage of XCT over the other contact or non-contact measurement techniques is that it is a powerful volumetric measurement tool in evaluating the three-dimensional statistical details of the internal defects (such as microscopic pores) including their morphology [16],size [17],density [18,19] and spatial distribution [8]. Thus XCT has been popularly deployed to analyze the correlation between pore characteristics and the mechanical properties of the SLM processed products. Salarian et al. [7] characterized detailed pore information including size,morphology and orientation using XCT and established a relationship between these pore characteristics and tensile properties of Inconel 625 samples fabricated by SLM technique.Siddique et al.[20] highlighted the effects of pore morphologies,spatial locations and clustering on the fatigue life of SLM processed AlSil2 alloy. Zhang et al. [21]deployed XCT to investigate the porosity-driven cracking mechanism and to bridge the gaps between SLM process parameters and internal structure of 316L stainless steel.A recent review [22] summarized the current development of XCT porosity characterization and its contributions on analyzing mechanical properties of additively manufactured products.",

    "content": "As pointed out in [23],it is meaningful to make use of the threedimensional pore characteristics including distribution,size,morphology and density,characterized by XCT analysis,in predicting their effects on the mechanical properties of the final product.The concept of such predictions were realized in a few recent works by combining the XCT analysis with numerical techniques such as finite element scheme, which demonstrates great capability in incorporating the pore characteristics to predict the mechanical properties.Esposito et al.[9] proposed an interaction procedure between XCT and the finite element method in predicting the mechanical behavior of AlSiloMg fabricated by the SLM technique.The numerical results were verified with the relevant experimental results.Glinz et al. [18] deployed XCT in analyzing the pore size distribution of seven SLM fabricated Ti6Al4V pedicle screws,and generating finite element model by extracting several cubic regions of interest from the reconstructed three dimensional model of each screw to correlate the pore size distribution and elastic properties.However,as reported by the recent review [22], the great potential of numerical modeling on a basis of the XCT data has not been explored extensively.Particularly, the studies on micromechanical modeling for bridging the microscopic defect details characterized by XCTanalysis and the mechanical properties of additively manufactured materials are still very limited.",

The transmitted signal of the X-ray beam is captured by the areal array detector such that the 2D image of the attenuation distribution at a specific scanned angle is recorded. Upon the completion of the rotation, thousands of 2D images are acquired and subsequently used to reconstruct a high resolution 3D volume by a computing algorithm.In this study, the specimens were placed as close as possible to the X-ray source to optimize the magnification and resolution of the imaging process.\n\nAfter the scanning and reconstruction,a porosity analysis module together with VG Studio Max3.0 (Volume Graphics GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) were applied to analyze the internal imperfections such as pores and inclusions by investigating voxel data sets and thereafter to provide the statistical information consisting of the details of each individual defect. The pore analysis was performed by using the VGDefX algorithm [28] in three steps.First,each voxel of the scanned specimen was investigated to determine whether it represents a part of a defect; Second,all the connected voxels picked up in the first step were grouped together and identified as one defect; Last,each defect candidate was analyzed to determine the pore details such as volume, equivalent diameter,morphology and so on.The statistical pore characteristics obtained from the XCT analysis will be used in constructing the micromechanical model in Section 3.",

    "content": "This paper presents experimental characterization as well as micromechanical modeling with statistical considerations to investigate the effects of pore characteristics on the mechanical properties of 316L stainless steel (SS3l6L） processed by selective laser melting. Firstly, tensile test specimens following ASTM E8 testing guidelines were fabricated using four sets of SLM process parameters with low and high energy input. Secondly,experimental techniques were adopted to characterize the SLM processed SS316L, including X-ray computed tomography (XCT） for characterizing the internal pore characteristics such as size,density,morphology and spatial locations as well as mechanical characterization for the tensile properties. Most importantly,a micromechanical model was proposed to predict the effective properties of the SS3l6L.The model was developed by a periodic representative volume element (RVE) technique,where each RVE includes the statistical information of the pore characteristics from the XCT quantitative analysis.\n\nFrom the XCT analysis,the specimens processed using the low energy input are observed to have much higher percentage of large pores with the sizes above $0 . 1 1 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ than those processed using the high energy input.This may directly result in a larger porosity in the low energy input processed specimens.More interestingly,the mechanical properties of the SS3l6L are found to not only depend on the energy input in the SLM process,but also relate to the size distributions of the large pores.Even for the process parameters giving rise to the same energy input, the specimens with a higher relative frequency of the large pores above $0 . 1 1 5 \\mathrm { \\ m m }$ present worse mechanical properties, especially lower ductility,due to the stronger stress concentration surrounding the large pores.",

    "content": "The numerical results from the micromechanical-statistical modeling show that 2Oo pores are sufficient to homogenize the elastic properties of the RVE and 1O realizations per sample are adequate for statistically inferring the elastic properties of the SLM processed 316L stainless steel.Parametric studies are conducted to study the effects of the pore distances and the pore size distributions on the predicted elastic properties.The prediction results show good agreement with two analytical solutions and the experimental characterization of the mechanical properties.It demonstrates that the proposed micromechanical model can be used as a potential tool in predicting the elastic properties for the future designer by saving the expensive destructive testing.\n\nThe present micromechanical model provides a computational framework which emphasizes the effects of pore characteristics on the effective properties of SLM processed materials.The numerical predictions are expected to be improved in future works by taking into account the crystallographic and morphologic texture formed in the AM process.Moreover,although the XCT porosity characterization for the AM parts has been validated by benchmarking with the other porosity measurement methods such as microscopic inspection [15],Archimedes method and so on [45],there are challenging metrological issues such as accuracy,uncertainty and traceability to be fully understood and resolved.",

Moreover,the fatigue life estimation for as-built specimens was performed based on surface roughness parameters as well as the fatigue properties of the specimens in machined/polished surface condition of the material withoutusing any fatigue data of specimens in as-built surface condition.Accordingly,the effect of surface roughness on the fatigue behavior could be estimated reasonably well in both strain-life and stres-life approaches.",

In summary,appropriate surface characteristic parameters capable of capturing the severity of the SR on the fatigue performance should be introduced before AM parts with AB surface conditions can be designed and considered for fatigue-critical applications.\n\nIn this study,the fatigue behavior of 304L stainless steel (304L SS) parts,manufactured via the laser beam powder bed fusion (LB-PBF) AM technique,with two different surface conditions,including AB and machined and polished (M/P) is investigated.SR measurements are conducted by a digital 3D microscope and values of various SR parameters are provided for a comprehensive understanding of the effects of surface texture on fatigue behavior.Both strain-and force-controlled fatigue tests are conducted and a previously established technique [24,39] to evaluate the fatigue performance for AM Ti-6Al-4V parts is utilized to predict the fatigue life of LB-PBF 3O4L SS specimens in AB surface conditions. The meta-stable nature of 304L SS (i.e.the tendency towards to martensite transformation） and its complex deformation behavior make it an excellent material to test concepts of fatigue resistance and failure mechanisms,particularly compared against a less complex,mostly elastic behavior such as the one for AM Ti-6Al-4V under cyclic fatigue loading.As such, the differences between strain-life and stress-life fatigue behaviors are also considered.",

    "content": "SR parameters for each facing direction (i.e.North,East, South,and West in Figs.2 and 3) were investigated to decouple any directional effects on the fatigue behavior. The differences in surface texture are quantitatively shown in Table 2 and Fig.4 with the directions corresponding to Fig.3(a).Interestingly,the south facincg direction shows less variation in the measured data,which may be related to the lower extreme surface roughness values for each parameter when compared to the other directions.Despite these lower extreme values,however, the box and whisker chart provided in Fig.4 suggests that none of the measured directional surface roughness parameters are significantly different. Such a lack of directional dependency on SR may be influenced by both a vertical build orientation and acylindrical shape which reduce stair effects and friction of recoater.In addition, SR was measured from cylindrical specimens which provided geometrical disparity, hence it contains more variations.Although the directional dependency of SR was not significant in this study,it should be noted that more systematic studies,which are beyond the scope of this work,have reported some directional dependencies of LB-PBF Ti-6Al-4V[43].",

This in conjunction with the unstable deformation behavior shown in the AB hysteresis loops presented in Fig.8(c) demonstrates the sudden loss of stability for the AB surface condition can be attributed to the fast propagation of cracks initiated from the surface and them quickly merging with each other.\n\nUnder stress-based conditions (i.e.force-controlled testing),the true stress increases significantly as the cracks grow and the coalesce from multiple cracks and promotes crack instability,ultimately yielding shorter fatigue lives.Under strain-based loadings (i.e.strain-controlled testing),the deformation is controlled,so despite the decreasing load bearing area attributed to crack growth,stiffness drops,the stress response does not increase as much,and crack stability is maintained throughout the fatigue life.As such,the strain-life fatigue behavior is less sensitive to SR as compared to stress-life fatigue behavior.",

    "content": "The characterized fracture surfaces show that SR can be a dominant factor in crack initiation and the reason for the shorter fatigue lives in AB specimens.AB surface topology can be categorized by peaks and valleys with un-melted or partially melted powder particles mostly contributing to the peaks.The peaks on the surface do not affect the fatigue behavior,however,the valleys on the surface of AB specimens act as micro-notches promoting early life crack initiation [24].As a result, the AB specimens can be considered as notched specimens due to SR,with the most severe notches contributing to the lower fatigue resistance of AB specimens.Several factors dictate the severity of micronotch with the depth and sharpness of the valley most likely being the dominant characteristics.\n\nIn order to estimate the effect of SR on fatigue strength in this study, the SR is considered as micro-notches and the stress concentration factors are calculated based on the Arola-Ramulu model [39,50]. Height-pixel SR data generated by digital focal variation microscopy are evaluated.

Through a rigorous experimental approach, the sensitivity to surface roughness was investigated for both stress-based and strain-based fatigue testing through post-mortem fracture analysis,and classical fatigue modeling approaches.Several interesting and impactful conclusions can be drawn from this study as listed here:\n\n1.Surface roughness measurements on the various faces and specimens from different locations on the build plate suggest that while directional effects on surface roughness are minimal, there is a certain locational dependency based on the position of the part relative to the inert gas inlet. However, the effect of locational dependency on the surface roughness of LB-PBF 3o4L SS was also found to not be statistically significant.\n\n![](images/08ca42add2d66404c9482337b240c21b94429afb16eeaefa1beb1f42c8a8142d.jpg)  \nFig.13.(a) Strain-life fatigue plot based on experimental data forM/P specimens and estimated curve for AB specimens based on correcting the elastic strain behavior using an effective fatigue notch factor with SR parameters.The blue dashed line and dash-dot line represent the experimentally obtained elastic and plastic strain-life of $\\mathtt { M } / \\mathtt { P }$ specimens.The red dashed line represents the estimated elastic strain-life of AB specimens.

    "content": "In closing,the results and analysis presented in this study demonstrate a simple approach for predicting the detrimental effect of as-built surfaces on the fatigue behavior for both stress-and strain-based loads. While these results have shown success for both 304L SS and Ti-6Al-4V [24],which show vastly different cyclic stress-strain behaviors,additional studies on other additive manufactured metals including post processing are necessary to further validate this method.For example, Ni-based superalloys are particularly interesting as AM is increasingly being explored for fabricating high temperature turbine blades with internal cooling channels.Additionally,as Ni-based superalloys and many other materials require extensive post-process including surface and thermal treatments to achieve desired mechanical performance, understanding the influence of such treatments on the surface condition and resulting fatigue resistance is critical. Showing success of this approach for additional material systems and surface conditions would further advance additive manufacturing as a universally applicable technology to fabricate fatigue and fracture critical components with complex geometries.",

    "content": "Notice that a number of deposition parameters have the influences on the quality of the fabricated parts [6],among which laser power, scanning speed,particle size distribution (PSD) and powder bed thickness play dominant roles in the surface morphology and properties of the components.In order to study the influence of process parameters, experimental efforts have been taken to understand the complex thermophysical interaction processes from the perspective of the powder bed generation process [7,8], process parameters [9],common defects [10]. Dursun et al. [11] analyzed the effects of laser power and scanning speed on the surface characteristics of SLM parts.According to their study,detrimental defects,discontinuity,pores and cracks on the surfaces could be generated at a higher scanning speed.Gong et al.[12] focused on the defect formation mechanism during the powder bed fusion processes.Their study indicated that the energy input had a significant effect on defect generation. The mentioned researches provide an improvement in understanding SLM formation.However, the scientific understanding of the complex relationship between process parameters discussed above and the final products is incomplete.Relying solely on the trial-error method to find the appropriate process parameters during the SLM experiments is time-consuming and costly. Furthermore,figuring out the multiple complicated physical phenomena of the SLM process is challenging through the experimental analysis [13]. Therefore, numerical simulation can be a valid tool for enhancing the physical understanding of the SLM process.",

    "content": "Over the years, massive researches have focused on the morphology and the formation mechanism of defects using a mesoscopic model at the powder scale. Qiu et al.[1O] established a powder-scale model closely mapping interfacial forces such as surface tension,Marangoni force and recoil pressure.Their study revealed that increased powder bed thickness contributed to the possibility of the presence of porosity.It should be noted that the regularly packed powder bed differed from the actual power bed in terms of particle size distribution and particle spatial distribution. Therefore, modelling the powder bed generation process as close to the actual condition as possble is a premise before establishing a powder-scale SLM model based on the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method. The powder spreading process mainly involves particle size distribution and powder bed distribution.Due to the presence of issues mentioned,the discrete element method (DEM) is always adopted to simulate the powder bed spreading process.Lee and Zhang [14] adopted the discrete element method (DEM) and the finite volume method (FVM) to research the influences of laser power, scanning speed and powder particle distribution on the molten pool.Their study implied that a faster scanning speed and a lower laser power led to the balling defect. Khairallah et al.[15] proposed a relatively comprehensive model considering the recoil pressure and the Marangoni effect to explore the formation mechanism of common defects during the laser powder bed fusion process.Their model expounded the formation mechanism of spattering,denudation,pore defect. Furthermore,their study revealed the significant effect of the recoil pressure and the Marangoni effect. Yan et al.[16] built a multi-physics field model to identify the formation mechanism of single/multiple-track defects during the EBSM process.",

    "content": " They found that the energy input and the powder bed thickness significantly affected the presence of the balling defect,and the powder size distribution and powder bed thickness were two pivotal process parameters for the single melt track nonuniformity. Qian et al.[17] investigated the influence of process parameters on surface morphology. They found that scanning speed was a critical parameter which was closely related to the dimension of the molten pool and surface morphology.Le et al.[18] developed a physics-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with the application of the ray-tracing technique.Their model demonstrated that the unstable behavior of the molten pool and keyhole accounted for the porosity defect. Most of the aforementioned numerical models mainly concentrate on investigating the influence of various parameters.The formation mechanism of defects during the SLM process has been the focus of intense study over the past several years.However, the comprehensive understanding of the formation mechanism of defects and the influence of process parameters on the forming quality is still lacking.\n\nIn this work,the powder spreading process of powder bed based on the discrete element (DEM) method was applied to generate a powder bed.A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, in which the recoil pressure and the Marangoni effect were considered,was developed to investigate the formation mechanism of common defects and analyze the forming quality of the single melt track.Meanwhile, corresponding experiments were conducted for the fabrication of melt tracks to validate the numerical model. This paper is expected to provide the guidance for reducing or eliminating common defects during the SLM process.",

The simulation of powder bed generation process could mainly be divided into two steps: firstly,a collection of powder particles dropped vertically onto the plate to form a particle pile; secondly,the blade moved along the plate at a specified speed, some particles were pushed into the building chamber to form the powder bed used to manufacture the parts,and others fell into the container.\n\nIn the powder bed generation process,the particles modelled as discrete entities update their physical states and motions determined by Newton's second law.The contact forces between spherical powder particles can be decoupled into the normal and tangential force.In the normal direction,a contact model with the non-linear elastic HertzMindlin algorithm is utilized to figure the elastic normal contact force [19],and the damping force is added artificially to solve dissipation of kinetic energy [2O,21]. The elastic normal contact force and damping force can be expressed by the following equations:\n\n![](images/d9b6a187fae2bdb82296f3d34ca57e0bcee284066708e7fab095991bcc207f14.jpg)  \nFig.1.The snapshot of powder bed generation process.",

    "content": "It could be found from Fig.8(a)-(i) that when the laser energy density was low, the random distribution of powder particles on the scanning track had a significant influence on the molten pool.The cause of the distortion defect can be concluded in the following perspectives.The spatial arrangement of powder particles in the layer is random,and small metal particles can be completely melted with less heat.The substrate below the small particle aggregation region is prone to be melted,the partially melted larger particles in the single melt track are dragged into the molten pool for the effect of the surface tension. On the otherhand,the temperature of partially melted large particles in the periphery of the laser beam is relatively low,resulting in the large surface tension gradient between the molten pool and the partially melted particles.The molten pool is distorted under the Marangoni effect.Based on the results,itis demonstrated that the random distribution of powder particles on the scanning track is important for the development of the distortion defect. Due to the random distribution at the scanning track edges of powder particles with different sizes,itis diffcult to obtain a completely straight melt track without the distortion defect.Therefore, it is suggested that the distortion phenomenon can be improved by appropriately reducing powder particle size.",

Therefore,the efects of the energy input on forming quality would be discussed in this section.Based on the simulation schemes,group B had a constant laser power of $1 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { W }$ ,and four different scanning speeds were chosen. Group B was applied to investigate the effects of the energy input on the forming quality of the single melt track.\n\nThe surface morphology of the single melt track obtained from simulation (calculation scheme B4) and the experiment is illustrated in Fig.9.The result of the simulation agreed well with that of the experiment.A discontinuous track with the balling defect was formed in the calculation scheme B4 (150 W, $1 3 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s $ ). Due to the low heat input, there were still a large number of voids between the melt track and the substrate,which led to bad connectivity between the melt track and the substrate (Fig. 9(b)). The balling phenomenon occurs commonly during the SLM process when the inappropriate parameters are utilized, causing the poor bonding between layers,low density of parts and even damaging to the blade when the height of the ball is higher than designed layer thickness [31].",

    "content": "To further understand the forming process of the balling defect, Fig.lO illustrates the simulation results of the temperature field in the calculation scheme B4 at different times.The molten pool directly below the laser beam was unstable,and the rear end was quickly disconnected from the front end, forming the balling defect.As shown in Fig.10(b), due to the non-uniformity of the powder bed,a small void appeared in the middle of the molten pool.As the laser moved forwards,the gap continuously increased,as shown in Fig.1O(c).The melt track was completely broken and divided into two parts,and the rear end formed a ball (Fig.1O(d)). The formation of void and its expansion were caused by a strong backward flow driven by the surface tension caused by the temperature gradient.Discontinuous characters of the melt track could be recognized in the periphery of the melt track (Fig.10(e)-(f)).\n\n![](images/40f16b6cfaa11061b12c72c41439ef59b2edec99de8a5a27ca10b88a3dc4d4b7.jpg)  \nFig.8.Simulated and experimental results of the distorted track $( \\mathrm { P } = 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { W }$ $\\mathbf { v } = 1 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s ,$ : (a)-(h) simulation results at different times,(i) experimental result\n\n![](images/7a1f90aed501b8901688d61cf5dbe76333b33949eb02ba608c4c42631bc4c98e.jpg)  \nFig.9.Simulated and experimental results of calculation scheme B4: (a) 3-dimensional view; (b)sectional view $( \\mathtt { Y } = 1 5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ ; (c) corresponding experimental result\n\n![](images/0025d6b174fb6a40fc442fe34e16de08a60df16d58e9211c104646c1ed3c464c.jpg)  \nFig.10.The formation process of the balling defect in calculation scheme B4.",

    "content": "Based on the above discussion, the cause of the balling defect can be summarized.Insuficient energy input is incapable of melting the substrate below the powder bed.When the substrate below the powder particles is melted,the wetting behavioris beneficial for the spreading of the melted particles on the substrate,contributing to the sound bonding between the solidified track and the substrate [16,25].According to the analysis above,the issue of insufficient melting of the substrate below the powder bed is responsible for the balling defect.The effective approach of diminishing the balling defect is to provide sufficient energy input.Additionally,a thinner powder bed composed of particles with smaller sizes can be used to ensure a well metallurgical bonding between the melted particles and the substrate.It is noted that suficient energy input can ensure powder particles fully fused and bonded with the previous layer,avoiding the possibility of interlayer defects.\n\nFor the same powder bed, the surface quality of the melt track in the calculation scheme B3 (150 W, $1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s \\mathrm { \\Omega }$ was improved,a continuous but nonuniform melt track was formed, as illustrated in Fig.11.As can be seen in Fig.1l(a),spatter was generated due to the instability of the molten pool under the interaction of the Marangoni effect and the recoil pressure.Another issue was the occurrence of the denudation zone. In the calculation scheme B2 (150 W, $6 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s $ ,witha higher heat input than that in the calculation scheme B3 or the calculation scheme B4, the melt track was even and straight,as shown in Fig.12. Under the combined effects of the Marangoni force and the recoil pressure,a larger depth was generated.A perfect wetting effect between the molten metal and the substrate was obtained to avoid the occurrence of the balling effect.",

    "content": "Finally,the keyhole-mode laser melting occurred when the laser scanning speed further decreased to $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s$ .The collapse of the keyhole is responsible for the appearance of the porosity,and the formation mechanism of porosity is similar to that of deep penetration laser welding [32]. The flow pattern of the melt within the molten pool was strongly influenced by the interaction between the surface tension and the recoil pressure and other factors [25].Therefore,the flow of the melt within the molten pool exhibited unstable dynamic behavior,leading to the porosity defect.\n\nThe forming process of the pores in the keyhole-mode laser melting process is shown in Fig.l3.The melt flowed randomly on the front of the keyhole wall.At the rear of the molten pool, the flow of molten metal was very complex and unstable.The flow direction of the melt is shown in the white line segment in Fig.13(b).The melt flowed downward near the surface of the rear wall of the keyhole while the melt at the rear area of the keyhole flowed upward along the fusion line,resulting in a clockwise vortex at the rear area of the molten pool. Such melt flow patterns mainly caused by the recoil pressure and the surface tension were also observed in the laser welding simulation [32,33]. The flow field signed by the black arrows indicated that the fluid velocity near the keyhole was more drastic than that of other parts of the molten pool, revealing the melt near the keyhole flowed with a strong and unstable flow pattern.Due to the melt backflow,a hump was formed on the rear wall of the keyhole.The severe fluctuation and instability of the keyhole caused the collapse of the hump,and the pore was generated at the bottom of the keyhole,as shown in Fig.l3(c)-(e).A hump collapsed again so that a pore formed again (Fig.l3(f)).Notably, the gas pores rapped in the solidified metal led to the residual pores.",

Microstructure-based processng maps as a function of volumetric energy density were generated.The combination of HT and LT methods produced a predictive relationship between hardnessand primary dendrite arm spacing using a Hal-Petch relationship.A model is proposed to explain the dependence of microstructure on the melt pool geometry.The HT method can be applied for the microstructural design of SLM-fabricated components in other alloys.\n\n# 1．Introduction\n",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is a process to fabricate components through the layer-by-layer deposition of materials.Examples of metal powder AM techniques include selective laser melting (SLM),directed energy deposition (DED),and electron beam melting (EBM) [1]. The underlying principle behind these processes is to introduce material in powder or wire form and melt them using a high energy source such as a laser or electron beam. Over the past decade,the SLM process has gained high interest especially among energy,defense,and aerospace industries [2].The SLM process enables the printing of complex geometries with the potential for lower cost and minimizing material waste [2,3]. However, SLM parts often contain processing defects such as porosity, inclusions,residual stress,and anisotropic properties.The defect concentration,microstructure,and property anisotropy depend upon processing conditions such as laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing, and layer thickness [1,2,4].As a consequence of processing defects, qualification and certification of fabricated parts can be challenging [5] and limit the use of metal AM parts.To fully exploit the SLM process,it is necessary to design, predict, and control the microstructural development in viable processing ranges.",

    "content": "Processing ranges in SLMare bounded by the challenge to fabricate a defect-free,fully dense component.Many studies [6-9] have focused on pore characterization and how these defects form during AM processing. Pores due to localized lack-of-fusion are commonly observed in AM parts where insufficient input energy results in weak bonding between the layers [lO].Ina study by Mukherjee etal.[11] a normalized heat-input parameter (non-dimensional number) showed a linear dependence with the amount of lack-of-fusion defects.Conversely,keyholing occurs due to excessively high energy input [l2].These solidification defects can lead to catastrophic failure.For example,failure analysis ofadditively manufactured 316L SS specimens showed the initiation of cracks at the fabrication-induced pores and defects during tensile testing [13].In as-fabricated AM parts,defect morphologies,which can vary from spherical pores to high aspect ratio cracks,can also impact failure. For example,accelerated crack initiation was observed in the specimens having lack-of-fusion defects during a high-cycle fatigue testing, whereas a minimal effect was observed in specimens having small equiaxed pores [14].",

    "content": "Another challenge in the SLM process is the ability to predict and control the microstructure.Solidification microstructures are considered complex because of the moving localized heat source that overlaps with existing fusion tracks [5,15].In addition,the moving heat source thermally affects prior layers asa function of spatial and temporal processing conditions.The solidification microstructural features depend mainly on the melt pool size and solidification conditions (i.e., thermal gradient (G) and solidification rate (R)) [6].High thermal gradients and high cooling rates associated with the metal AM process result in the formation of microstructures consisting of high dislocations densities,low angle grain boundaries, sub-granular cellular structures, andcrystallographictexture[4].Microstructuralanalysisof SLM-fabricated 316L SS shows the presence of columnar grains and cellular-dendritic structures [l6] with a cellular spacing increasing with the energy input [17].Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses of SLM 316L SS show the presence of dislocation networks in the cell boundaries region [4,l8],which could be effective in blocking the motion of dislocations.In addition,epitaxial grain growth can occur multiple deposition layers,resulting in microstructures textured along the building direction.A study by Bertoli et al.[19] showed that crystallographic texture is strongly related to the melt pool geometry and hatch spacing.",

    "content": "When processing conditions are well selected,as-fabricated AM316L SS can show higher strength and ductility as compared to wrought 316L SS [2O].The main factors attributed to a strength increase are the cellular dendritic structure,grain size,and dislocation density [18,21, 22].The increase in ductility was attributed to a higher propensity for deformation twinning [4,23,24].AM 316L SS also showed excellent fatigue strength and fatigue crack growth threshold values as compared to wrought materials,primarily due to high yield strength to tensile strength ratios [25,26].However, the columnar grain and crystallographic texture in the build direction can often lead to anisotropic properties.For example,in 304L SS higher ductility was observed along the transverse direction,as compared to building direction,while,both directions showed similar tensile strength [27].",

    "content": "Metal AM processing with SLM is controlled by at least 100 process variables [28].Of these variables,laser speed,laser power,and hatch spacing are the more common and easily adjusted ones.Selecting the adapted variables for a given material,powder feedstock [29],and application can be challenging and time-consuming and often relies on trial and error.\n\nHigh-throughput (HT) experiments may permit faster rates of design of experiments (DOE),particularly when guided with a fundamental premise [30,31].Large datasets obtained from HT experiments can be used as training sets for various machine learning algorithms [32,33] and can be used to predict the process parameter ranges.Ren et al. [34] have demonstrated the combined use of HTand machine learning for the discovery of metallic glasses.Specifically,forAM,givena known set of process parameters corresponding to specific material,HT can allow a systematic interrogation of processing parameter variations.Moreover, the interdependence of the parameters can be developed to rapidly define correlations not available in existing models.Recent studies [35, 36] using an automated HT tensile test were performed to evaluate the effects of processing parameters on the mechanical behavior of AM 316L SS.Other studies [37] have focused on HT process control via in-situ monitoring of the melt pool. To expand the AM techniques to other alloy systems,HT experiments are needed to quickly fabricate,characterize,and identify the appropriate processing window, especially since there are a large number of processing variables in the SLM technique.",

    "content": "Power-Velocity (PV) processing maps are a powerful way to visualize the effects of AM processing parameters on microstructure and performance.Processing maps for SLM techniques have been systematically used by Beuth et al.[38] where different regions of defects (i.e., lack-of-fusion and keyholing) were mapped at different laser power and scanning speed combinations.These maps provide useful information about the defect population and processing window to fabricate full density specimens.A few other recent studies [39,4O] have also extended this idea and constructed processing maps for different alloy systems using experimental and computational techniques. Processing maps for welding,deformation, other manufacturing techniques were previously developed to guide users about the optimum processing conditions.However,most of these studies have focused on defects at different processng conditions,and there is a lack of understanding about microstructure evolutions at these conditions.\n\nThe novelty of the current work lies in using high-throughput fabrication and characterization techniques to quickly analyze SLMfabricated 316L SS.These techniques allowed the identification of the processing bounds within a reasonable time frame of 2-3 days. Following the HT synthesis and characterization,low-throughput (LT) microstructural investigations on key specimens were performed to define the critical microstructural featuresand to generate microstructure-based processing maps.This study will provide insights into the microstructural evolution and microstructural design strategies for SLM-fabricated parts.The new methodology can be applied to other alloy systems for rapid processing parameter discovery.",

Since FCC crystals grow preferentially along the [1oo] direction [48],most of the grains show crystallographic texture trending towards the (100) plane.The model presented is supported by experiments at a VED of $\\mathbf { \\bar { 1 5 1 . 5 \\ J / m m ^ { 3 } } }$ where the coarsest average grain size of $3 5 . 0 7 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and a primary dendrite arm spacing of $0 . 5 6 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ were observed (Fig.11).

The high-throughput approach is a quick, reliable,and effective way for designing processing bounds of as-fabricated SLM components.\n\na)A hex nut geometry is useful for high-throughput fabrication, density and hardness measurements.   \nb) Quick density and hardness measurements enabled mapping of the lack-of-fusion region and keyholing regions,and both regions were supported with analytical model.   \nc) The high-throughput analysis can be completed in a 2-3 day period,allowing rapid definition of process parameters for an alloy system.\n\n2.Energy densities permit microstructural design strategies with lowthroughput studies.\n\na)At lower energy densities of $\\mathrm { ( V E D = 6 9 . 9 \\ J / m m ^ { 3 } ) }$ finer grains, low grain aspect ratios,finer dendritic structure,and more random texture were observed.   \nb)As the energy density increased,coarser grains with higher grain aspect ratios were observed.   \nc) Under a constant energy density,the microstructure remained unchanged.   \n3.The variation in microstructures at different energy densities can be explained in terms of melt pool geometry. Lower energy density results in shallower melt pool and faster cooling rates lead to more randomly oriented, fine grain structures.Higher energy densities result in deeper melt pools and slower cooling rates,leading to coarse elongated grains with a texture towards (11O)and (1oo) planes with respect to the build direction.   \n4.High-throughput regression of hardness as a function of volumetric energy density (VED) was consistent with a Hall-Petch relationship corresponding to the primary dendrite arm spacings (determined with low-throughput characterization).",

However,widespread applications and market penetration of such components are often hindered by the formation of common defects that afect part quality,reliability,and serviceability,and increase the cost. Here,for the first time,we show that a combination of physics-informed machine learning,mechanistic modeling,and experimental data can reduce the occurrence of common defects in additive manufacturing.By analyzing experimental dataon the defect formation for commonly used aloys available in the disjointed,peer-reviewed literature,we identify several important variables that reveal the physics behind the defect formation.Values of those variables computed using a mechanistic model,when used in a physics-informed machine learning,provide the hierarchical importance of the variables on defect formation.In addition,based on the results of the physics-informed machine learning,we provide easyto-use,verifiable,quantitative formalism that can be used in real-time to predict defects before experiments.The proposed methodology can help in reducing common defects such as baling,cracking,lack of fusion,porosity,and surface roughnes,and solve other complex engineering problems beyond additive manufacturing.\n\n$^ { © }$ 2021 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM) of metallic materials is a rapidly progressing field because of its capability to fabricate complex,and intricate components easily and economically for aerospace,consumer products,healthcare,energy,automotive,and marine industries [1-4]. Stainless steels [5],aluminum [6,7], titanium [7,8], and nickel alloys [4] are regularly printed to make customized parts and other important components on demand [9],such as patientspecific medical implants [1O]. Starting with a three-dimensional digital drawing of the part,metals are deposited layer by layer,often thinner than human hair, to form components [3]. However, after about a quarter of a century of research and development, only a handful of commercial alloys can be additively manufactured,and the market value of all such products now amounts to a negligible portion of the manufacturing economy [4].This difficulty is largely attributable to the susceptibility to common defects,such as porosity, cracking,lack of fusion,balling,and surface roughness [3,4].These defects affect part quality,reliability,and serviceability, and often lead to part rejection.In addition,some defects require post-processing of the part which increases cost. Therefore,AM of defect-free,high-quality parts in a time-efficient and cost-effective way is a major challenge to the materials community [1,2,4].",

    "content": "Currently,defects are minimized by using the traditional approach of optimizing processing conditions by trial and error[11- 26].This technique is not optimum for AM because of the need to conduct many experiments to explore a large range of process parameters and high costs of feedstock and machines combined with a changing economic culture where new products are rapidly created.In addition,trial-and-error tests do not always achieve the desired conditions to mitigate defects because of the complex nature of AM process.Prediction and control of defects require both theories of metallurgy and knowledge of how the process conditions and alloy properties affect the mechanisms of defect formation [3,4]. Mechanistic models of AM processes can predict physical attributes that affect defect formation such as the temperature and velocity fields,molten pool geometry,cooling rates based on process variables,and thermophysical properties of alloys using phenomenological understanding [27-44]. If this understanding is lacking but data are available on process conditions,alloy properties,and defect formation,machine learning [45,46] can make valuable contributions to control the defect formation in AM [47-58].A synergistic application where the machine learning is trained using the data that capture the physics behind the defect formation (physics-informed machine learning）and are computed using a mechanistic model [43,44], can provide important quantitative correlations between the process attributes and defect formation. Such correlations are important because they can reduce the number of experiments needed to achieve low defect,highquality AM parts.",

The formation of balls can require post-processing,reduce dimensional accuracy, degrade fatigue properties,and may hinder the movement of powder spreading roller which interrupts the process [3,4]. Several examples of experimental trials [11-26], the use of mechanistic models [27- 44],and machine learning [47-58] to adjust process parameters for reducing balling defects are provided in Table 1.Eforts have been made to explore the mechanistic factors impacting balling defects. Heat energy per unit volume of material deposited controls the melting of alloy powders which affects the balling defect [17,33,49,50,59]. Similarly,surface tension force on the top surface of the molten pool and convective flow of molten metal have been related to the mechanism of ball formation [15,16,19,25,27- 30,33,60-62]. Furthermore,balls are formed by the disintegration of the molten pool due to the hydrodynamic [21,35] and capillary instabilities [30-34,43,50]. These important factors are quantified in the literature and their values have been evaluated for various experimental conditions and alloy compositions using mechanistic models (Table 1） to reduce balling defect.All of these factors depend on the alloy compositions and process parameters,and the effects of each factor on balling defects have been studied separately.However,the combined effects of these important factors on balling defects during L-PBF have not been investigated.",

    "content": "Since the effects of process parameters and alloy properties are important for controlling the quality of the AM parts,it is intuitive to try to correlate them with the occurrence of balling defects.The process parameters are easy to measure during the experiments,and material properties for common aloys are readily available in the literature.The ten most important parameters include laser power, scan speed,powder diameter, beam diameter, layer thickness,thermal diffusivity of alloy and shielding gas,surface tension force of alloy, latent heat of alloy,liquidus temperature of alloy [3,4]. Process parameters corresponding to one hundred and sixty-six experimental data sets are provided in the Supplementary document. The range of process parameters and material properties are listed in Table 2.Thermo-physical properties of six alloys investigated in this work are available in Table 3.To resolve the roles of these parameters on the balling defect,we need a minimum of $2 ^ { 1 0 }$ （1024） reproducible experiments based on the L2 design of experiments [63]. In addition,no comprehensive investigation of the roles of process parameters and alloy properties would provide any insight into the mechanism of balling. Therefore,the process parameters and alloy properties are not suitable to use in machine learning to forecast balling using the available pool of literature data.\n\nTable 2 Ranges of process parameters,material properties,and six mechanistic variables [11-16].

    "content": "A solution is to use mechanistic variables that represent the physics of the problem.A similar example can be found in the flow of a Newtonian fluid through a pipe.The structure of the flow,laminar or turbulent,is best determined by Reynolds number rather than the individual values of velocity,density,and viscosity of the fluid and the pipe diameter [51]. In AM,several mechanistic variables have been related to the balling defect. They include volumetric energy density,surface tension force,Marangoni number, Kelvin Helmholtz hydrodynamic instability represented by Richardson number,capillary instability represented by pool aspect ratio (pool length/pool depth),and solidification time of the pool. These six mechanistic variables need only $2 ^ { 6 }$ （64）experimental data points to forecast their effects on balling defects.These mechanistic variables can be calculated using a heat transfer and fluid flow model which involves process parameters and alloy properties.It will be shown that a physics-informed machine learning that relies on the computed values of mechanistic variables can forecast balling (Fig.1） and provide mechanistic insights that cannot be obtained by any other means.\n\nPhysics informed machine learning correlates the balling defect with mechanistic variables that can reveal the mechanisms of balling based on the laws of physics.For example,the pool aspect ratio (pool length/pool depth),and other variables computed using principles of physics can then be analyzed using machine learning to correlate them with the occurrence of balling.A high pool aspect ratio indicates high Plateau Raleigh capillary instability which makes the pool likely to separate into small spherical balls to maintain the uniform capillary pressure inside the pool.All six mechanistic variables can be calculated using a well-tested mechanistic model that includes all process parameters,alloy properties, and gas properties as required inputs.",

The values of the six mechanistic variables are computed using a well-tested,3D,transient,heat transfer,and fluid flow model of L-PBF[43,44].The inputs to the model are the process parameters,alloy,and gas properties,while the outputs from the model include the temperature and velocity fields in three dimensions from which the six mechanistic variablesare estimated.Details of explanation and validation about the model are described in previous publications [43,44] and are not repeated here.Only the salient features are indicated here.The model is applied in a 3D solution domain containing the substrate, power bed,deposited tracks,and shielding gas.The calculations are performed using an in-house Fortran code compiled using an Intel Fortran compiler. The temperature-dependent thermophysical properties of the six alloys are provided in Table 3.The model was run for all 166 experimental cases to calculate the mechanistic variables.\n\nThe effects of the six mechanistic variables on balling (Fig. 2) and their calculations using the heat transfer and fluid flow model are described below.\n\nThevolumetric energy density (E): Low energy density at a low laser power and rapid scanning speed provides too little energy input per unit length.The insufficient energy to form a proper molten pool results in a discontinuous molten pool that solidify with several small bals (Fig.2,top left）[11-19,22- 25,28,30,33,49,50,59]. The volumetric energy density (E） is expressed as [3,4].",

The resulting deposit appears similar to what is observed as the humping effect in fusion welding [36,37,4O]. However, the literature from which we collected the experimental data, termed this defect as balling. This hydrodynamic instability can be represented by a dimensionless number called the Richardson number [21,35].The susceptibility to the balling defect increases with Richardson number due to high pool instability [35]. Richardson number (R) can be calculated as [3,35].\n\n$$\n\\mathsf { R } = \\mathrm { \\frac { g L } { ( U _ { g } - U _ { l } ) \\vphantom { \\frac { g L } { 2 } } } }\n$$\n\nwhere $^ { \\mathrm { g } }$ is the acceleration due to gravity,L is the pool length that can be calculated using the 3D,transient,heat transfer,and fluid flow model. $\\mathrm { U _ { g } }$ is the velocity of shielding gas,for L-PBF,which is assumed to be equal to the scanning speed. $\\mathrm { U } _ { \\mathrm { l } }$ is the maximum velocity of the convective flow of the liquid metal.The maximum velocity is found on the top surface of the pool along the scanning direction.",

    "content": "Pool aspect ratio (ε): Similar to the hydrodynamic instability, capillary instability can also disintegrate a molten pool and cause balling. Capillary instability of the molten pool is quantified by the pool aspect ratio,which is a ratio of pool length to pool depth (Fig.2,top right).When the length of the molten pool is signifcantly larger than its depth (high aspect ratio),the pool becomes unstable and breaks into small balls [13,15,16,18,19,23,24,30- 34,43,50,61,62,64,65]. Pool aspect ratio (ε) is expressed by the ratio of pool length to the pool depth.Both pool length and pool depth can be calculated using the 3D,transient,heat transfer,and fluid flow model for different process conditions and alloys.\n\nSurface tension force (F): Surface tension maintains the integrity of the top surface of the molten pool (Fig.2,bottom left).At low surface tension force,the molten pool may be disintegrated and forms balls [15,16,19,25,27-30,33,60-62]. Surface tension force (F) is calculated as the product of the coefficient of surface tension of an alloy and the circumference of the molten pool on the top surface.The coefficient of surface tension of the six alloys is provided in Table 3.The circumference of the molten pool is calculated on the top surface assuming the pool be an ellipse.The major and minor axes of the elliptical pool are assumed to be the pool length and width,respectively, both of which can be calculated using the 3D,transient,heat transfer,and fluid flow model.",

This convective flow is also known as Marangoni flow,represented by the Marangoni number (Fig.2, bottom right).A low Marangoni number represents a weak convective flow that is insufficient for uniform spreading of molten liquid which may cause balling defect [11,18,27,29,43,62].

The genetic algorithm provides the coefficients corresponding to each variable for BSI for the six mechanistic variables (Table 2). The coefficients of which have the minimum square error in ftting the balling results using the six mechanistic variables are selected.

The balling susceptibility index increases with the increase of Richardson number (orange） and the pool aspect ratio (blue） because of their positive coefficients in Eq.(4).For the absence of balling (Fig.a),the computed BSI values are less than the threshold value of O.5 (Fig.4).In contrast, the values of BSI are higher than 0.5 when balling Was found (Fig.b) (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend,the reader is referred to the web version of this article.).",

    "content": "The computed values of BSI can be used to predict balling defects for a new set of process conditions using the six mechanistic variables before doing experiments.With the six mechanistic variables calculated using the well-tested,heat transfer,and fluid flow model of L-PBF,balls may form if the calculated BSI using the computed values of mechanistic variables is higher than O.5.For example,we consider two sets of experimental data for the presence and absence of the balls in L-PBF of Inconel 718 from the literature [16].BSI values calculated for these two cases( $\\mathrm { B S I } { = } 0 . 0 1$ and $\\mathsf { B S I } { = } 0 . 6 1$ )are indicated in Fig.4 which are consistent with the corresponding experimental evidence.The sign of the coefficients in Eq.(4) indicates how a mechanistic variable influences balling. For example,Richardson number(R) and pool aspect ratio (ε） have positive coefficients which show that balling defect increases at a high value of these two variables.Similarly, negative coefficients of volumetric energy density (E),Marangoni number (M),surface tension force (F),as well as solidification time (T) indicate less chance of balling for their high values.For all 166 data points, $6 0 \\%$ of them are used for training dataset (51 cases of $\\mathbf { \\delta } ^ { \\mathbf { \\delta } }$ and 49 cases of ‘1'), $1 0 \\%$ are used for validation (8 cases of $\\mathbf { \\cdot } _ { 0 } \\mathbf { \\cdot }$ and 8 cases of ‘1'),and $3 0 \\%$ are used for testing dataset (26 cases of $\\mathbf { \\delta } ^ { \\mathbf { \\prime } } \\mathbf { 0 ^ { \\prime } }$ and 24 cases of ‘1').With rigorous mathematical derivation,validation,and testing, the BSI can forecast balling with $9 0 \\%$ accuracy, $9 1 . 6 \\%$ sensitivity, and $8 8 . 4 \\%$ specificity [51,52,68].

The surface tension force has the least influence on the balling defect. The same hierarchical importance of the six mechanistic variables on balling defect is also found using three different feature selection indexes in machine learning,information gain (Fig.7 (b))，information gain ratio(Fig.7(c)） and Gini index(Fig.7(d)） [52,68]. Calculations of these three indexes are discussed in Section 2.The Marangoni number has the highest value of both information gain and information gain ratio calculated based on entropy,which indicates the Marangoni number as the most important variable for the balling defect. Similarly,the highest influence of the Marangoni number on balling is evident from its lowest value of the Gini index among the six variables indicating its lowest impurity in data classification.The distribution of the two most important mechanistic variables,Marangoni number and solidification time for 166 data are plotted in Fig.7(e） and (f)，respectively. Both variables(Fig.7 (e）and (f)） have shown obvious trends in delineating cases presence and absence of balls formation.The hierarchical importance of variables on balling defects will guide engineers to identify the most important factors to tune in to prevent balls in L-PBF.",

These maps when rigorously tested against independent experimental data can be made available on the shop floor for real-time prediction of ball formation before performing experiments.",

    "content": "Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) is one of the recently studied research areas, due to its ability to eliminate different subtractive manufacturing limitations,such as dificultly in fabricating complex parts, material wastage,and numbers of sequential operations. Laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) AM for SS316L is known for complex part production due to layer-by-layer deposition and is extensively used in the aerospace,automobile,and medical sectors. The process parameter selection is crucial for deciding the overall quality of the SS316L build component with L-PBF AM. This review critically elaborates the efect of various input parameters,ie.,laser power, scanning speed,hatch spacing,and layer thickness,on various mechanical properties of AM SS316L, such as tensile strength,hardness, and the efect of porosity, along with the microstructure evolution. The efect of other AM parameters, such as the build orientation, pre-heating temperature,and particle size, on the build properties is also discussed. The scope of this review also concerns the challnges in practical applications of AM SS316L.Hence, the residual stress formation, their influence on the mechanical properties and corrosion behavior of the AM build part for bio implant application is also considered. This review involves a detailed comparison of properties achievable with different AM techniques and various post-processing techniques,such as heat treatment and grain refinement effects on properties. This review would help in selecting suitable process parameters for various human body implants and many different applications.This study would also help to better understand the effect of each process parameter of PBF-AM on the SS316L build part quality.\n\nKeywords: powder-bed fusion; process parameters; corrosion behavior; residual stresses; bio implant",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM) offers plenty of advantages over the conventional manufacturing process, due to the layer-by-layer deposition of materials. The applications of additive manufacturing are increasing exponentially, especially in the medical [1] and aerospace industries [2], due to their unique feature of fabricating complex geometrical components. Powder-bed fusion AM uses thermal energy to selectively fuse powder particles on a powder bed as mentioned in the ASTM standard [3]. Laser powder-bed fusion (L-PBF) is one of the most studied AM processes for metal printing. The optimum process parameters are of utmost importance to obtain the desired properties. Many process parameters,such as powder characteristics,laser type, chamber environment, etc., are involved,and input process parameters make this process quite complex [4]. Hence, there is a need to optimize the process parameters to achieve desirable properties.",

    "content": "Stainless-steel implants have been in use for years; however, with the conventional process, there are certain limitations regarding complex shapes and sizes.The implants made with AM techniques are free from conventional challenges and also provide better properties. Several researchers reported that with conventional processes, the metal ions dissolved in blood and urine after 10-13 bio implants in the human body [5]. Most of the implants failed, due to poor corrosion, fatigue, and wear resistance [6]. Hence, the improvement in the properties of SS metal implants is a promising area for researchers. Bio implants by additive manufacturing garner much attention because of their many advantages, compared to conventional manufacturing, such as ease of handling, complexity, minimal material wastage,and ease in operation [7]. There are always internal stresses induced in powder-based additive manufacturing, due to sequential heating and cooling [8]. The residual stress degrades the overall quality of the building part in terms of poor mechanical properties. Hence, the relation between the residual stress, input parameters,and properties need to be explored.",

The literature collected over the past 10-15 years is on powder-based additive manufacturing of SS316L. The main four process parameters, i.e., laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing, and layer thickness, and their influences on mechanical properties are considered. In the first section, the effect of the process parameters on tensile strength, hardness,and porosity with microstructure evolution is explained. In the second section, the corrosion and residual stress behavior of additively manufactured SS316L with process parameters are described. To conclude, all the reported process parameters on AM-SS316L and their influences are considered. This study will help to define the process parameter window for future applications to obtain desired strength and hardness. This study also helps by collecting allthe process parameters effects reported till date for LPBF AM of -SS316L, this collected data can be used for future work in machine learning for the optimization of process parameters.",

    "content": "Tensile strength is one of the important factors considered to evaluate the quality of the build part. In AM, many parameters are involved at a time. Hence, it is essential to observe the effect of each parameter on tensile strength. This section covers powder selection, all the AM input parameters, the optimization of parameters, chamber environment, post-processing techniques, and comparison of tensile strength with other manufacturing processes in terms of properties and microstructural point of view. The selection of powder size plays a crucial role in the output mechanical properties. The smaller powder particles produce a denser product with minimal porosity and decreased chance of internal defects. Chen et al. [9] examined the effect of powder particles on mechanical properties with an energy density of $5 5 . 5 5 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ and observed that a finer particle of around ${ \\sim } 1 6 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ gives the highest tensile strength in the range of $6 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { M P a }$ as shown in Figure 1. The fracture surface with dimples as shown in Figure $\\ 1 ( \\mathsf { A } _ { 2 } , \\mathsf { B } _ { 2 } )$ also implies the ductile failure of the sample.",

    "content": "The layer-by-layer deposition gives sequential heating and cooling, which results in a finer austenitic grain structure, compared to other conventional manufacturing processes. Hajnys et al. [10] investigated the optimization approach, using Taguchi to establish the relation of process parameters on mechanical properties. They stated that the most influencing parameter for tensile strength of AM build parts is the scanning speed followed by the scanning pattern and laser power. They obtained maximum and minimum tensile strengths at $6 5 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s }$ and $1 2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s }$ scanning speeds, respectively. Wang et al. [11] also reported that at lower energy density, due to insufficient melting, the viscosity of the liquid melt pool is poor. Hence, the spreading of liquid metal is difficult, which results in porosity. At a higher energy density level, the liquid formation is enough for uniform spreading of liquid metal, which makes a denser structure. They observed that at energy density of $1 2 5 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ , the highest tensile strength around $5 9 0 \\mathrm { M P a }$ was achieved. The fracture morphology at different energy density is shown in Figure 2. The chances of large crater voids are high,and cracks propagate easily, due to local britleness at lower energy levels. The fracture morphology is different at different energy density inputs. At the energy density of $1 2 5 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { \\bar { m } m } ^ { 3 }$ ,more densification can be observed in Figure 2B. Hence, the tensile strength increases,and the further increase in energy density makes larger and shallower dimples,which reduce the tensile strength.",

The observation from collated data is plotted concerning different parameters. The overallinfluence of energy density on ultimate tensile strength is shown in Figure 3. The graph shows that the tensile strength increases with incremental increase in the energy density, due to better densification. However, at a higher energy density, keyhole porosity leads to restrict the further increment in tensile strength. The optimal energy density for the better tensile property is in the range of 50 J/mm³ to 105 J/mm.\n\n![](images/527a4028870421f71b92b0eca6db762b77c465d293c1a6d691e9fcd7a741e8a3.jpg)  \nFigure 1.

Tensile strength at a different energy density.\n\nThe microstructure evaluation has a vital role in the mechanical properties in particular; the strength of the component depends on grain size and dislocation density. The refined grain structure greatly influences the porosity, residual stress, and strength of the components. The SLM process generates a finer microstructure, compared to the direct energy deposition (DED) process, due to more grain refinement. The SLM microstructure contains a higher dislocation density, compared to DED and other conventional processes.",

    "content": "The dislocation hinders the movement of discontinuity. The heat treatment reduces the strength from 671 MPa to $6 1 6 \\mathrm { M P a }$ in the SLM part and $6 4 5 \\mathrm { M P a }$ to $6 0 0 \\mathrm { M P a }$ in the DED build part [12]. The heat treatment does not show much improvement in the mechanical property of ${ \\mathrm { S S 3 1 6 L } } ,$ as phase transformation does not occur. The best alternative to heat treatment is the solid-state grain refinement process, which improves the strength along with ductility [13]. The preheating of the base plate up to a certain temperature gives a lower thermal gradient, which provides good mechanical property and denser part with minimal defects. Zhang et al. [14] investigated the effect of preheating temperature and build orientation on density, strength, and deformation. The tensile strength specimen for vertical build-up and horizontal build-up is shown in Figure 4. They obtained the highest strength and dense part at the $1 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ preheating temperature.\n\nTable 1. Tensile strength at different process parameters.   ",

    "content": "The build orientation and location in the build plate also affect the strength of the component, as the fracture behavior is different when horizontal vs. vertical [18,19]. Casati et al. [20] plotted the stress-strain behavior of tensile specimens built vertically and horizontally with $5 8 0 ~ \\mathrm { M P a }$ and $6 8 4 ~ \\mathrm { M P a }$ of UTS. This can be atributed due to loading different loading directions in vertical and horizontal build parts. The higher scanning speed creates a small melt pool with lower weting characteristics, leading to separate solidification, popularly known as the balling effect',and a highly porous structure. The highest tensile strength $( 6 5 0 \\mathrm { M P a } )$ could be obtained with a scanning speed of $9 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s } ,$ whereas a higher scanning speed of $1 8 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ gave poor mechanical properties [21]. Li et al. [22] used the same approach to produce a component with gradual property increment, which is mostly used in biomedical applications. The layer thickness plays a crucial role in the strength and surface finish of the build part. Delgado et al.[16] examined the effect of parameters on mechanical properties for DMLS and SLM. They observed that as the layer thickness decreases, the partial re-melting of previous layers occurs, making proper diffusion between the layers. Hence, the maximum strength $5 8 0 \\mathrm { M P a }$ is reported with $3 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ of layer thickness. Reddy et al. [23] approached the small-scale testing sample for AM,as the overall cost of DMLS is higher, and compared the characterization with the standard sample size. They reported that the tensile strength of SS316L is $5 0 0 \\mathrm { M P a }$ and $5 1 6 \\mathrm { M P a }$ for small scale and standard size samples, respectively.",

    "content": "The particle size alone does not show much effect on hardness; rather, it more depends on the scanning pattern and varies in each build direction. Chen et al.[9] found that for finer particles, the hardness in the XY cross-section (276 HV) is lower than the hardness in the YZ (286 HV) and XZ (291 HV) cross-sections. Pannitz et al. [24] performed a comprehensive study on five different powders available of SS316L at standard process parameters and found that the achieved average hardness is $1 9 5 . 4 \\ : \\mathrm { H V } .$ The hardness value is strongly correlated with the porosity. Hence, the parameters which reduce the porosity will result in higher hardness. Tucho et al. [25] investigated the effect of porosity, scanning speed, and hatch spacing on hardness. They reported that as the energy density increases, the hardness of the component increases linearly up to a certain level and decreases due to gas trapping pores generated at a higher energy density. The maximum and minimum hardness were observed as $2 1 3 \\mathrm { H V }$ and $1 7 6 \\mathrm { H V }$ for the energy density of $8 0 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ and $5 0 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ , respectively. The hatch spacing also affects the hardness level; the minimum hatch spacing of $8 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ gives the maximum hardness for the $8 0 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ energy density. The data of the effect of different process parameters on as build hardness of SS316L are collected from the literature as shown in Table 2. The observation from the collated data is plotted concerning different parameters, such as hatch spacing, layer thickness, and energy density. The overall efect of hatch spacing on hardness from the collected literature data is shown in Figure 5 [24].",

    "content": "Tolosa et al. [29] also reported that as the energy density increases, the hardness increases up to $2 2 5 \\mathrm { H V }$ $1 2 5 \\mathrm { { j / m m } } ^ { 3 }$ . The hardness highly depends on the scanning speed, wherein the higher scanning speed leads to a faster cooling rate, which results in a finer grain and increases the hardness. Sun et al. [28] experimented with the productivity of the SLM process at a higher scanning speed. The hardness value was found to be in the range of $2 1 3 \\mathrm { H V }$ to $2 2 0 \\mathrm { H V } ,$ which is greater than that of the SS316L annealed part. The reason for the higher hardness is due to nano-amorphous inclusions (known as silicate), which increase the dislocation density. Inclusion depends on the oxygen contained in the build chamber, which generally should not be more than $0 . 0 5 \\%$ [28]. Cherry et al. [26] also reported that the optimum values of laser power and energy density could increase the hardness value. Delgado et al. [16] investigated the efect of process parameters on hardness and reported that the hardness value decreases as the build direction changes from $0 ^ { \\prime }$ to $9 0 ^ { \\prime }$ . The increment in the layer thickness and scanning speed also reduces the hardness. Hitzlerr et al.[17] reported that hardness does not show much variation for inplane anisotropy for the different scanning strategy. Yusuf et al. [15] stated the vital result that the hardness value does not change with different build directions. However, hardness is different for the different scanning directions. They measured the value of hardness for the ${ \\mathrm { X Y , Y Z , } }$ and XZ planes and found 262 HV, 239 HV,and 237 HV, respectively. Revilla et al.

    "content": " [31] also studied that in the AM process, due to finer grain size, the dislocation density of the austenite cell is higher; hence, the strength and hardness could be achieved to be higher than the conventional processes. however, porosity must be optimized in a controlled manner. Muley et al. [13] also reported that as the grain size decreases, hardness increases. The warm multi-axially forged process increases the hardness of AM build parts, due to the ultra-fine grain structure. Yusuf et al. [15,32] investigated the effect of grain refinement on mechanical properties of SS316L. They used a high-pressure torsion technique on an AM build part and achieved almost twice the hardness, from 250 HV to $5 2 5 \\mathrm { H V } ,$ due to refinement of the cellular structure, which effectively reduces porosity. PagáC et al. [33] investigated the effect of process parameters on hardness and concluded that laser power and heat treatment do not influence the printed parts. The hardness of the printed part was found to be around 50 HRB higher than the rolled part. However, the heat treatment tends to reduce the hardness,due to recrystallization. Chimmat et al. [34] compared the effect of heat treatment at $6 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ;$ expectedly, hardness reduces to 185 HV from 210 HV. Reddy et al. [23] reported a similar trend that after the heat treatment, due to stress release, the hardness value drops by $1 2 \\%$ . The tempering temperature also contributes to determine the hardness of the component, as the percentage of retained austenite influences the hardness value. Chen et al. [35] experimented with the SS316L at different tempering temperatures and found that the maximum hardness of $6 2 0 \\mathrm { H V }$ could be achieved between $4 2 7 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $5 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ tempering temperature.",

The metallurgical pores are generated, due to the oxygen content and other inclusions, in $1 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ with a spherical shape. The keyhole pores occur at a higher scanning speed. Generally, keyhole pores formed irregular shapes of more than $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in size as shown in Figure 8 Metallurgical pores are not very dependent on process parameters, whereas keyhole pores can be controlled by controlling the energy density. Pagac et al. [33] explained that a process with high laser power could give lower porosity at a constant scanning speed. On the other hand, the annealing heat treatment tends to expand the pore and thus, increases porosity.\n\n![](images/44fc77199cc5a1a09e5786ae327dee31e0f107ab6b4656825435204ec148c696.jpg)  \nFigure 8.

    "content": "The finer powder particles generate a denser product, as more surface area is available to absorb the laser energy, resulting in the complete melting of particles. The highest density $( 9 9 . 9 9 \\% )$ is reported with a particle size range of 5 to $4 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ [9]. The porosity and distribution of pores is the main factor that affects the mechanical property of the build part, rather than the influence of energy density in SLM of SS316L. Wang et al. [36] demonstrated that, even with constant energy density, a porosity above $0 . 1 1 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ results in a drastic reduction in the mechanical properties, due to an increase in the stress concentration around the pores, which reduces the ductility.\n\nThe optimum energy density is the critical parameter for the dense structure and is achieved by the essential selection of the laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing, and layer thickness. The part produced with a lower energy density may have unmelted particles, which results in a porous structure. The higher energy density creates a steep $' \\mathrm { V } ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ shaped melt pool, which leads to micro evaporation from the melt pool; that gas is trapped below the melt pool, which again results in porosity. Tucho et al. [25] experimentally obtained the energy density levels for minimum and maximum porosity for SS316L as $8 0 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ and $5 0 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ , respectively. The SEM images of porosity shown in Figure 9 also conclude that the scanning speed directly affects the porosity level at lower energy density levels; as scanning speed increases, the porosity increases but at higher energy density, the scanning speed does not affect the porosity. The minimum porosity up to $< 0 . 0 3 \\%$ was observed at $7 5 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ energy density.",

    "content": "Cherry et al. [26] also investigated the importance of optimum laser energy density for minimum porosity. They observed a similar trend; as the energy density increases, porosity increases up to a certain level after which it decreases. The minimum and maximum were obtained at $1 0 4 . 5 2 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ and $4 1 . 8 1 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ ,respectively. The further increment in the energy density to $2 0 9 . 0 3 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ increases the porosity, due to the evaporation of microelements as shown in Figure 10 [28]. The data of the effect of different process parameters on the relative density of SS316L are collected from literature as shown in Table 3. The overall effect of the energy density on the build part density from the collected literature is shown in Figure 11, where the process window for the better density of SS316L includes using an energy density of 80 to $\\bar { 1 } 0 5 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ ：\n\nLi [22] also observed that a theoretical density $( 9 6 \\% )$ could be obtained with $9 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s }$ scanning speed, whereas if the scanning speed increases to $1 8 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s } ,$ density drastically reduces to $6 5 \\%$ . The porosity of the build part strongly depends upon the melt pool size variation, which is correlated with the laser power and scanning speed directly. Li et al.[22] also corelated the melt pool variation with the porosity. The higher scanning speed creates a very small melt pool, leading to a higher porosity with a lower tensile strength structure,as shown in Figure 12. This phenomenon could help build the gradient properties component, such as bio implants, where the scanning speed variation produces the gradient porosity component.",

    "content": "The porosity could also be due to the gas atomization of the powder material. Yusuf et al. [15] investigated the $\\mathsf { X }$ ray computed tomography (XCT) analysis for analyzing pore distribution. They observed that the scanning pattern also influences the pore size and distribution. The pores are located at the islands'interface region. The average length of the pores also in the expected zone of $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $4 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ for $6 0 \\%$ of the pores concludes that in SLM of ${ \\mathrm { S S 3 1 6 L } } ,$ a highly dense structure $( > 9 9 \\% )$ could be achieved. The vertical cracks contribute significantly to lower density and poor mechanical properties; thus, the scanning strategy must be selected accordingly, increasing the power input [36,37]. Dewidar et al. [38] also experimented with the porous structure for bone implants with $4 0 \\%$ to $5 0 \\%$ porosity, which has the desire elastic modulus of 26 GPa for the human body. Although the higher level porosity contributes to crack growth and failure mechanisms, the micro-pores' uneven distribution also plays a crucial role in the corrosion behavior [30]. Porosity also affects the creep life of the component. Dao [39] explained that the porosity exaggerates the cavitation effect, leading to reduced creep resistance. AlFaify [4O] performed the optimization of the process parameters with the regression model and found that layer thickness and point distance are the parameters that significantly afect the build part's porosity, whereas hatch spacing is the least affective for porosity.\n\n![](images/31bd9ae88a35fb4dba4add22b94a42f74acdf846345803b62478eac371e58be0.jpg)  \nFigure 13.

    "content": "Metal implants are used in different body parts, including as bone replacements, knee joint replacements, dental implants, screws, plates, etc., as shown in Figure 14 [43]. Metal implants in the human body are likely to degrade in the body environment. Human body fluid contains various ions and organic particles, which readily react with the fitted implants. The $\\mathrm { p H }$ value of the body is generally 7. However, it varies many times, due to acidity or any diseases or infections. This acidic environment also can be the reason for deviation in implant properties [44]. Various biodegradable metals are used in bio-implant applications,such as austenitic stainless steel, titanium-based alloys, cobaltbased alloys,and magnesium-based alloys. SS316L and Ti-6Al-4V are the most common materials used in different bio implant applications [45,46]. Metal implants have been used for years now, but still, there are specific challenges that were reported in recent years. Okazaki and Gotoh [47] reported that after 10-13 years, hip joint implants in the human body degraded and metallic ions were found in the human blood and urine. Most of the implants fail due to fracture, corrosion,and wear in the human fluid environment. Sivakumar et al. [48] reported that $9 0 \\%$ of SS316L implants failed, due to corrosion attacks in human body fluid. Two characteristics explain the corrosion phenomenon for steel implants: the first is the oxidation and reduction process with the environment, and the second is oxide layer formation, which prevents corrosion. Whenever these oxide layers are deformed, the surface starts to react with the environment and eventually degrades. This behavior is called passivity,and the oxide layers are called a passive layer [49]. The stability of the oxide layer in human body fluid is the most essential to prevent corrosion.",

    "content": " Several types of corrosion failure were observed for bio implants: pitting corrosion, fatigue corrosion, stress corrosion, and inter-granular corrosion [49]. Corrosion is the most affecting factor in implant failure; however, wear and fretting, surface cracks,and porosity also contribute to the failure of a bio implant. The combination of al mechanisms leads to early failure of the implant. Hence, the surface properties and mechanical properties both are equally important. The new layer-by-layer additive manufacturing techniques have started developing customized and complex implants with ease [50]. The AM build part of SS316L has different mechanical and microstructural properties, compared to the conventional manufacturing process. Hence, many researchers have started to explore the corrosion behavior of SS316L implants fabricated using AM. The corrosion performance measured with a similar environment to human body fluid to reflect the same situation is called in vitro analysis. The various fluids developed in laboratory to simulate the same behavior are called simulated body fluids, such as Ringer's solution, Hank's solution, phosphate buffer saline (PBS), human serum and other physiological simulated body fluids [5oj. The general corrosion behavior of a material is evaluated with a standard testing procedure (according to ASTM F2129 or ASTMG 61) called potentiodynamic polarization [49,51-54]. Many researchers compared the corrosion behavior of SS316L with AM and wrought alloy in simulated body fluids. Revilla et al. [30] reported interesting work by comparing the corrosion behavior of SS316L builds by different AM processes. Their work concluded that the highest corrosion resistance was found in the SLM part followed by LMD and wrought alloy as shown in the polarization curves of Figure 15. This phenomenon can be attributed to different microstructure evolution with SLM and DED,where the much finer structure in SLM shows better corrosion performance.",

It is observed that the heterogeneous microstructure for wrought alloy and very finely distributed sub-granular structure exists in the AM part [56-58]. Suryawanshi et al.

    "content": "Another study reported that AM part performs well in a corrosion environment, compared to wrought alloy, due to a layer-wise refined microstructure, the absence of MnS inclusions,and more robust passivity behavior [61,62]. Nie et al. [62] also reported the analysis of film stability in the AM part in the environment of a $3 . 5 \\mathrm { w t \\% N a C l }$ solution. The dual-phase passive film containing oxides and hydroxides of Cr and Fe was observed in the AM part and wrought alloy. High corrosion resistance was found in the AM part because of the thicker and more stable passive film found in the AM part. The effect of the grain size on corrosion behavior showed some contradictory results. Ralston et al. [63] reported that Sometimes, a finer grain structure increases the corrosion behavior because as the boundary density increases, better adhesion of the passive film is observed. Sometimes the passive layer formation depends upon microelement distribution and environmental conditions. Hence, with AM implants, some contradictory results were also reported. The AM implants show beter corrosion resistance, compared to the conventional manufacturing process [64]. This can be atributed to the unique heating and cooling mechanism in layer-by-layer manufacturing. The higher cooling rate of around 107 K/sec leads to a finer microstructure, rapid boundary diffusion, and uniform element distribution. Hence,less time for Mns nucleation reduces the Cr-depleted zone in AM of SS316L 63,64]. The various postprocessing techniques were also examined to improve the corrosion resistance and surface property of bio implants of SS316L [65,66]. Zhou et al. [67] used the post-annealing of an SS316L build part to enhance corrosion resistance. They found that intergranular corrosion starts from the melt pool boundaries in an as-built sample as shown in Figure 19.",

    "content": "The main consequence of additive manufacturing is internal residual stress generation in the process. The layer-by-layer continuous heating and cooling cycle leads to generate thermal stress in the build component. This residual stress reduces strength, surface cracks, delimitation from the base plate,and distortion,and results in decreased overall quality of the part [68]. There are three types of residual stress generated in the build part, namely, Type-1, Type-2,and Type-3. The stress generated at the macro level inside the build part due to thermal deformation is termed Type-1. The stresses generated at the micro level due to grain orientation and anisotropy at the atomic scale are called Type-2 and Type-3, respectively [69]. The residual stress generation phenomenon is dependent upon two cycles of heating and cooling. There are three different zones developed in the heating and cooling phase: the melting zone,heat-affected zone,and unaffected zone. In the heating phase, the powder exposed by a laser beam is heated to a higher temperature and tries to expand. Since the surrounding powders are colder, they try to restrict expansion. Hence, where the laser beam is spotted on those locations, compressive residual stress is generated [70,71]. Once the laser beam is passed from a particular location, the second phase begins a cooling phase. In the cooling phase, the high-temperature zone cools down immediately and shrinks. The previous plastic strain and bonding again restrict this shrinkage of the material with surrounding particles. Hence, in the cooling phase, tensile residual stress is generated. This tensile and compressive residual stressforms in every new layer deposition. This phenomenon of continuous heating and cooling is explained in Figure 21 [72]. The overall mechanism occurs is as more numbers of the layers are deposited, the lower layers try to expand,and the top layers try to compress [73].",

    "content": " Another mechanism occurs when the first layer is deposited on the cold surrounding deposited material, which shrinks immediately but contraction is restricted by the colder base plate and surrounding material. Hence, tensile residuals are generated on the initial layers, whereas the base plate compressive residual stress is generated [74].\n\n![](images/e8567dba1e581aa311d6805acd25c4583c156d96cd3a423effab191cbea360b7.jpg)  \nFigure 21. Residual stress generation (a) Heating, (b) Cooling [72].\n\nThe maximum residual stress in the yield strength range generally occurs at a higher temperature gradient,i.e.,joint of the base plate and first layer [75]. When the build part is removed from the base plate, residual stresses are reduced drastically due to minor deformation [76,77]. Hence, the overall trend of residual stress after removing the base plate is found to be similar by many researchers,as follows. The lower portion of the build part contains tensile residual stress, and further, as height ingresses, it converts into the compressive residual zone. Then, again, the top layers contain tensile residual stresses [73]. The value of residual stress also varies with the height of the build part; as more layers are deposited, heat accumulates in the deposited layers. The temperature gradient reduces with the height of the build part, leading to a reduction in compressive residual stresses. The residual stresses increase with the energy density, as significant molten pool results in more volumetric shrinkage. The density of the build part also affects residual stresses.\n\nResidual stresses are found to be lower with a more porous build part [38]. Manojakumar et al. [34] reported that optimized process parameters for density produce residual stress that is equal to half of the yield strength. They also reported that post-heat treatment of SS316L revealed residual stress compared to that in Figure 22 [14].",

Residual stress: as-built vs. post-heat treatment of SS316L [35].\n\nThe lower laser power process involves a higher cooling rate, which eventually increases the temperature gradient and residual stresses [78]. Tong et al. [79] reported that the laser power has a great influence on internal stress generation. As the laser power increases,residual stress first decreases and then increases. This phenomenon can be attributed to the cooling rate and melt pool formation. The increment in laser power reduces the amount of residual formation to some extent. The higher laser power also gives more extensive melt pool formation, which leads to more volumetric shrinkage. Yang et al. [80] explained the effect of the build height, direction, scanning pattern, support material on residual stress. They reported that the lower heat input and small line length produce low residual stresses. Mukherjee et al. [81] explained the effect of layer thickness and heat input on residual stress formation. The lower layer thickness reduces residual stresses by $3 0 \\%$ . The lower thickness involves higher exposure time, and it reduces the overall temperature gradient. The highest residual stresses were generated at the end of the tracks. This is why the build part is to be warped or delaminated from the base plate [82,83]. There are several destructive and non-destructive methods used to measure the residual stress, such as the hole drilling method, X-ray diffraction, neutron difraction, crack compliance method, and magnetic Raman [84-87].",

Several techniques can be used to reduce the residual stresses, such as preheating of the base plate,re-scanning of the tracks [85], post-heat treatment of the build part [86], laser shot pinning, the addition of dwell time between layer deposition, optimized orientation, and the location of the build part [74,75,87-92]. Shiom et al.

Additionally, there are some new types of approaches in the measurement of residual stress of AM part suggested by Kluczyhski et al. [94,95], which significantly afect the fatigue properties of AM-made 316L steel [96-98], which was shown in the co-authors' own work.

The different electrochemical behaviors of the PBF-AM build SS16L part are discussed. The corrosion behavior is observed to be different, due to layer-wise microstructure evolution in AM. The process parameters, environment, micro elemental segregation in AM,and different passivation behaviors play an important role to decide the life of a bio implant in the human body. The AM shows better corrosive resistance in the human body; however, the influence of each process parameter, microstructure evolution, the effect of different phases,and elements studied in this direction are required to better understand corrosion behavior of AM parts. Residual stress is the most affecting factor to degrade mechanical properties of an as-built part of AM. The formation of residual stresses and their influences was covered.

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM) also known as 3D printing, is an advanced manufacturing method for fabricating products, which differs fundamentally from traditional manufacturing methods like casting and machining.In AM,a three-dimensional computer aided design (CAD) model is converted into a physical object, built layer by layer,without restrictions on the geometry's complexity and pre-process preparation. Through the utilization of AM procedures,it is possible to rapidly fabricate prototypes (rapid prototyping-RP),tools (rapid tooling-RT) and even functional commercial products (direct manufacturing—DM) [1-3]. In the last three decades,laborious research has been conducted targeting the optimization of AM procedures.AM offers to industries, among others,the ability to fabricate complex geometries creating light-weight and structurally optimized products for mechanical applications (i.e.engine's brackets for automotive or aircrafts) or to create stochastic geometries for biomechanical engineer operations (i.e.medical/dental implants) [4-8]. In 2OO9, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) established standards for AM technology,which led to the definition of eight AM methods according to the ASTMF2792-12A [9-11]. Table 1 documents the standard AM technologies coupled with a brief description of them [12].Depending on the feedstock material, various AM techniques can be employed to fabricate a product.More specifically, in case of using thermoplastic as raw material, the most suitable methods are fused deposition modelling (FDM) or powder bed fusion (PBF) and for photopolymer resins the material jettng (MJ) and stereolithography (SLA)\n\nTable 1 Additive manufacturing processes [12]   ",

    "content": "According to existing literature [1,13,14], there are several concerns about the binder jetting, sheet lamination and cold spraying technologies that hinder their application for industrial manufacturing of metal parts.Binder jetting technique glues metal particles together with a bonding agent compromising the mechanical behaviour of the produced object [13,15].To address this problem, the components undergo infiltration or sintering process to increase the parts'density resulting in enhanced mechanical properties; however, these processes could lead in inadequate dimensional accuracy due to extensive shrinkage effect.In sheet lamination the metal sheets are welded together with ultrasonic welding or brazing leading in questionable mechanical performance due to the adhesive issues and intense anisotropy of the fabricated items [1]. Cold spraying adheres metal powder to the build plate with high deposition rates, which results to an enhancement of the product's mechanical properties.Nevertheless,this method is primarily used for coating deposition or repairing existing parts and it is not recommended for manufacturing components from scratch [14]. On the other hand,PBF and DED are the two most widespread metal AM methods with applications in various scientific sectors and industries.",

    "content": "PBF is an AM technique that utilizes either a laser or electron beams to sinter or melt the feedstock material correspondingly to manufacture a product. The feedstock material is in powder form and is typically spread along the building plate where the laser beam melts or sinters the powder particles according to the part's cross-section geometry, creating that way a thin layer of the overall geometry. Afterwards, the powder bed descends for a layer thickness and the process is repeated until the entire geometry of the object is created [16]. Figure 1 illustrates schematically the PBF technique. There is a plethora of PBF methods [17], where each process applies different principals to diffuse thermal energy as documented in Table 2.Furthermore,a wide range of metal materials are available for the specific manufacturing procedure such as stainless steels,aluminium alloys, titanium alloys etc. [8].\n\nDED process is mainly combined the gas metal arc welding process (GMAW) with robotic arms (cartesian, articulated, etc.) to manufacture the desired item.More specifically, it is a metal AM method where the feedstock material is in a powder or in a wire form.In this process, the raw material is spread by a nozzle and completely melted by either a laser, electron beams,a plasma arc or gas metal arc on the desired path to form a building layer[18,19]. The nozzles follow a predefined path to construct the cross-sections of the part's geometry and the final product is established layer by layer. The top part of Fig.2 shows a schematic layout of laser-DED process and the bottom part presents the classification between various DED techniques [20]. In DED processes,advanced metal materials such as titanium alloys,exotic materials,superalloys (i.e.inconel) are commonly employed [21].\n\n![](images/10db8c5bad17233d40a028abb01fcf1712ec8b119b37c4984a77d843775acd41.jpg)  \nFig.1 Schematic set-up of powder bed fusion\n\nTable2 Powder bed fusion methods   ",

The above-mentioned parameters are interdependent and interact with each other as presented in Fig. 3 [17,22].

In 2013,according to ASTM and International Organization for Standardization (ISO),a standardization was enacted regarding both the terminology and the printing orientations of all AM technologies [23].A coordinate system is defined with the $X$ -axis parallel to the front side of the machine, $Z$ -axis in the vertical direction and the $Y .$ -axis is perpendicular to the other two,and the positive direction is determined by the rule of the right hand. Figure 4 shows the graphical representation of tensile and fatigue test specimens accompanied by three capital letters $( X , Y , Z )$ ，which code the print orientation [24]. In particular, the first letter represents the axis that is parallel to the specimen's biggest dimension. In the same manner, the second letter is defined based on the next biggest dimension of the part [25]. The build orientation influences the overall quality of the object, i.e.surface quality, dimensional accuracy and mechanical behavior,as it willbe discussed in the next section. In general, the surface quality and the dimensional accuracy are depended mainly on the build orientation and the geometry of the component, as complex geometries tend to lead to lower quality [26].Additionally,mechanical behavior is primary influenced by the anisotropy effect that is created due to the build orientation of the product inside the build chamber of the AM machine [25,27].\n\n![](images/7c86a362c5d334daae102578e2e8fc37ae720b6e4c762db17152df8281219f8f.jpg)  \nFig.4 Graphical representation of main orientations for tensile and fatigue test specimens",

These process-related parameters are exhibited in Table 4 [29].\n\nHowever, there are some parameters that affect each AM process individually and are distinctive in these two metal AM techniques.More specifically, in PBF process: hatching distance: the distance between the centers of the laser beams in two consecutive laser paths. Overlap percentage: the percentage of an area that is scanned by a consecutive laser path from a previous laser path.Energy density: the energy that is absorbed by a region of the powder bed and affects the overburden and the unmelt raw material resulting to diverse qualities on the final product. The energy density is measured in units per volume and is computed by the Eq. 1 [28].

In case of using powder as the feedstock material, feeding rate is directly related to the speed of the carrier gas, the geometry of the nozzle and the properties of the powder [18,31]. An increased print speed is the outcome of high material feed rates which lead in a rapid construction of the product, but could potentially result to the reduced quality of the final object as explained in the next section [32, 33].

The lattice structures (infil pattern) are internal structure of a part and composes one of the main advantages of AM technology. Specific infill patterns reduce the relative density of the manufactured part resulting the minimization of the production lead time, the reduction of the feedstock material consumption and could lead in the fabrication of lightweight and structurally optimized products. Therefore, many engineers and designers prefer to apply specific internal structures, commonly named as lattice structures. However, lattice structures affect the integrity of the part, especially in terms of mechanical performance due to the size effect [34-37]. More specifically the size, the geometry and the relative density of each unit cell in a lattice structure possess severe impacts on the mechanical behavior of the manufactured component. Nowadays,research focuses on employing diverse lattice structures to identify each contribution and impact on the product's mechanical behavior.Figure 6 illustrates various lattice structures types applied in metal AM processes and their classification [35].\n\nTable 5 Nozzle and wire parameters   \n\n<table><tr><td>Parameters</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Wire diameter</td><td>Diameter of the applied wire</td></tr><tr><td>Feed rate</td><td>Extracted mass of the raw material per unit of time</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Feeding (clad) angleAngle between the nozzle and the building plate</td></tr><tr><td>Nozzle orientation</td><td>The orientation of material extrusion nozzle</td></tr></table>",

These procedures are usually the same as those applied in machining or die cast methods,i.e. heat treatments (aging,annealing etc.),hot isostatic pressing (HIP),polishing and shot peening.Postprocessing techniques could enhance the surface quality and the mechanical properties of a metal additively manufactured part, such as the tensile strength,hardness etc.[38-40]. However, metal parts should undergo different post-processing procedures depending on their applications.Mechanical polishing and electropolishing are employed for optimizing the external surfaces of an object.In general, the utilization of various heat treatments is suggested to optimize a specific mechanical property,achieving that way the desired mechanical performance of the printed component.\n\n# 3 Impact of process parameters in metal AM\nIn the previous section, the parameters that affect the metal AM procedures and possess a direct impact on the quality of the product (i.e.on surface roughness, dimensional accuracy and mechanical behaviour) were discussed.

    "content": "PBF and powder-feed DED processes present the same typical values for roughness average $( R _ { \\mathrm { a } } )$ , which ranges between 10 and $2 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ . However, the surface roughness for wirefeed DED procedures is significantly higher reaching up to $2 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ [32]. Studies have shown that the powder properties exhibit a dominant impact on the developed surface roughness,dimensional accuracy and mechanical properties of metal AM products [17]. In particular, the PSD and the apparent density are reported to compose major factors on the surface quality [41-44]. In those studies,specimens with various powder's properties were created and the asprinted surface roughness was measured using laser scanning microscope (LSM), X-ray micro-tomography (XMT) and profilometers.The results exhibited that a wide and fine PSD lead in better quality of the external surface.The finer particles are able to fill the holes between coarser particles resulting to lower values of the surface roughness.More specifically,according to Spierings et al. [41,42], it is possible to achieve $R _ { \\mathrm { a } } = 4 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ for aluminium alloy AlSil $0 \\mathrm { M g }$ in case of employing the appropriate manufacturing conditions,build orientation and feedstock material properties (PSD,apparent density).Furthermore,sharp particles with irregular shapes could cause low apparent density and coarser PSD,resulting to an adversely effect on the surface roughness and thus producing reduced surface finish [44]. Additionally,wider powders usually develop low flowability,which could affect other properties of an additively manufactured like its mechanical properties due to the creation of internal building flaws [17].Hereupon,a reasonable trade-off between PSD and flowability rates should be considered to manufacture high quality metal components with decreased internal build flaws and high surface finish.",

As mentioned in Table 5, the feeding orientation and feeding angle are two essential factors that affect the quality of a printed part.According to existing studies,among the three different possible nozzle's orientations in DED technology, which are shown in Fig.7, the one that results to the best surface finish is the front feeding,followed by the side and the back (rear) feeding [32,33,45, 46]. It is worth noting that in case of powder-feed DED process, the same trend is observed [18]. The range of the feeding angle depends from the combination of the feeding orientation and some geometrical restrictions due to the energy beam as illustrated schematically in Fig.7.More specifically, in case of the front feeding orientation, the angle ranges between $1 0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $7 5 ^ { \\circ }$ in contrast with the back-feeding orientation which varies between $1 0 5 ^ { \\circ } { }$ to $1 7 5 ^ { \\circ }$ [47]. According to Syed et al. [47], the best surface quality is obtained in situations where the front feeding orientation and a feeding angle between $2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ are employed, due to the minimization of adhesion's discontinuous of the material on the already printed object, known as rippling effect.\n\n![](images/b36b5a24d8aa995606e186eb438b211d37d50d0fdf9a30a8c14ef74d3d7ed0de.jpg)  \nFig.7 Graphical layout of nozzle parameters and possible nozzle's orientation",

Early studies focused on the geometrical characteristics of the 3D model in relation to the print orientation as well as the layer height, suggesting that the geometry with the lowest inclinations to the building direction coupled with low layer heights could produce the optimum results in terms of surface roughness [48-5O].Recent studies have shown that the surface roughness varies depending on the print orientation [26, 51, 52]. According to Simonelli et al. [53], the roughness on the surfaces that are parallel to the building direction could be three times deteriorated compared to other surfaces of the object. Therefore,the effect of the print orientation inside the build chamber should be taken into consideration to achieve the optimum results on the external surfaces of the part.",

In particular, existing studies have shown that the process-related parameters that possess significant influence on the surface finish are layer thickness,hatching distance,laser power,laser beam diameter, laser beam focus and laser speed [54-61]. Calignano et al. [29] employed Taguchi methods utilizing fractional factorial experiments (FFE) and concluded that the energy density possesses a narrow influence on the surface quality. However,the parameters that effect the energy density maintain individually high impact on the surface roughness [56, 58]. Fotovvati et al. [6O] clearly declares that low layer thickness induces high surface quality.It must be mentioned that there are other process-related parameters affecting two major phenomena that are directly related to the surface finish: the molten pools and the surface tension of the molten feedstock material. Applying proper laser power coupled with low hatching distance could potentially result in the creation of a uniform molten pool, producing that way flatten surfaces. Additionally, the utilization of high scan speeds can produce sufficient diffusion of the thermal energy shrinking the size of molten pool, hence the development of uniform melt pools is achieved, reducing that way the surface roughness [55,59]. On the other hand,according to Abd-Elghany and Bourell [54] in situations where the power of the laser is too high or the speed is too low,the intense surface tension of the molten pool combined with the balling effect could generate poor surface quality, especially on the top surface and the free side surfaces.Calignano et al.",

    "content": " [29] applied analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine the influence of process-related parameters on the surface finish and the results showed that the scan speed possesses the most dominant impact. Furthermore,according to the Attarzadeh et al. [61] applying high energy density (above $6 0 \\mathrm { ~ J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ ） coupled with high laser power, small hatching distance,small layer height and relatively high scan speed could decline the roughness on the in-plane surface below $4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ for Ti6Al4V samples fabricated with DMLS process. Gond et al. [62] and Lee et al. [63] investigated the influence of the laser beam diameter and the focus offset on the developed size of the molten pool. These studies indicate that an effcient thermal energy diffusion could be obtained via the regulation of the size of the molten pools by employing the appropriate laser beam diameter and suficient focus offset.\n\nPost-processing procedures that enhance the surface roughness in AM procedures are mainly the polishing and coating process [39, 64, 65]. According to Mower et al. [40], typical values of average roughness in DMLS and DED specimens are greater than $1 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ for soft alloys (i.e.\n\naluminium alloys $\\mathbf { A l S i l 0 M g } ^ { \\mathrm { ~ } }$ ） and greater than $1 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ for hard alloys (i.e. Ti6Al4V, SS316L, SS17-4PH etc.) [39, 59]. In addition, through the utilization of mechanical polishing, which causes the removal of high spots and also smooths the surface voids, it is possible to achieve roughness up to $R _ { \\mathrm { a } } = 1 . 1 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ [56]. In high-strength alloys (such as Ti6Al4V, SS316L, SS17-4PH), the roughness reduction is restricted and could reach up $3 0 \\%$ of the as printed value. Finally, the electropolishing process is suggested only on soft alloys,like the AlSi1oMg alloy, and retains less effciency compared to the mechanical polishing [40].",

    "content": "Print orientation affects the dimensional accuracy of the manufactured part; thus,the physical dimensions of the printed part could be either smaller or larger compared to the nominal 3D model [72]. One of the major reasons that constitutes to this behavioris the shrinkage effect that takes place in all AM procedures which involve the melting of the feedstock material. More specifically, studies have shown that the shrinkage phenomenon is anisotropic, so the influence on the dimensional accuracy is strongly depended on the print orientation [26]. Depending on the geometry of the product, alternating the print orientation could result to higher dimensional accuracy. Delgado et al.[51] and Ratnadeep et al. [73] concluded that the dimensional error at all the external surfaces is influenced by the applied build direction.According to their studies, in situations where the build direction varies from $0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , the dimensional error is significantly reduced in some surfaces (i.e.surfaces printed perpendicular to the build direction),while the other surfaces follow the opposite trend.",

According to Ziegelmeier et al. [44] and Liu et al. [78], mechanical behavior is mainly affected by the flowability, which is a bulk property of the powder. High flowability improves the part's relative density, fills the voids and avoids the generation of internal building flaws;hence it leads in the increase of the tensile strength,the enhancement of ultimate tensile strength,hardness and elongation at break.Besides the fact that flowability is affected by a series of variables as it is presented in Fig. 3, there are mainly two powder properties that have been deeply examined though the existing literature due to their severe impact on flowability, namely the PSD and the bulk density. Indicatively, narrow PSD and high bulk density result to an increased flowability [17]. In addition,the quality of the powder depends on the percentage of the recycled powder in the feedstock material mixture.\n\nTable7 Process parameters and their influence in dimensional accuracy   ",

    "content": "Anisotropy influences a variety of orientation-dependent physical and mechanical properties of a metal AM printed part. Anisotropy is calculated as a percentage between the value of the same property (physical or mechanical) in two different directions,the reference and the examined one [80].According to existing literature,anisotropy exists in all metal AM parts,but some metal AM methods exhibit less anisotropy behavior compared to others [25].In EBM and powder-feed DED processes the effect of anisotropy is mild and mainly affects the ductility, while the effect on tensile strength is negligible.On the other hand, SLM and DMLS procedures are strongly influenced by anisotropy regardless the mechanical properties of the employed material.Print orientation affects the mechanical behavior of a specimen produced via the SLM method in terms of reducing the tensile strength and increasing the ductility [53, 81]. More specifically,anisotropy results to notable deviations in tensile strength depending on the printing direction [27], which could reach up $2 5 \\%$ reduction compared to the reference value [82]. In EBM and powder-feed DED processes this difference is limited presenting almost $1 0 \\%$ decrease compared to the reference one [83, 84]. Anisotropy phenomena occurs in these AM techniques due to the facilitation of crack propagation in different directions. According to Seifi et al. [85], crack propagation follows the direction of the print course and could potentially lead even in the failure of the product. In addition, the fatigue properties of the product exhibit diverse mechanical performance along the horizontal and the vertical build directions. The fatigue properties of SLM parts are more severely afected from anisotropy phenomena compared to EBM and powder-feed DED procedures [24]. Furthermore, Jain et al.",

    "content": "Mechanical properties,such as structural strength and hardness are mainly influenced by the relative density of the part's internal structure.Relative density of metal AM products is always less than $1 0 0 \\%$ reducing the integrity on the mechanical properties of the object. This is mainly due to the presence of voids and entrapped gases within the structure,which are created during the metal AM process. Relative density is primary influenced by the following printing parameters: laser power, scan speed, hatching distance,layer thickness and energy density [88]. There are two major different mechanisms that create discontinuities: lack of fusion and keyholing [62]. Lack of fusion of the feedstock material may occur in situations where the molten pool has not adequate penetrated into the previously deposited layer and has failed to fully melt the feedstock material, resulting to the welding of unmelted particles on the last printed surface.Their removal from the coater could create a pit on the surface as illustrated in Fig. 8a. The second mechanism occurs when excessive energy source is applied on the feedstock material leading in the formation of regions with entrapped gases or Vapor in the internal structure of the product, i.e.keyholing as shown in Fig.8b.Mukherjee et al. [89, 90] showed that there is a relation between the two mechanisms and are strongly dependent on the applied material.More specifically, the materials that exhibit extensive thermal strain and distortion,like Ti6Al4V and AlSi10M, are more vulnerable at keyholing defects and composition changes due to the development of metal vapors; however, they minimize defects such as lack of fusion. On the other hand, the materials that are resistant at thermal strain and form small molten pools,like SS316 and Inconel 625,are most susceptible to lack of fusion defects.\n\n![](images/69517f9aad05a626891881876373962488929c817d2cc9e223c5c0971d0a8210.jpg)  \nFig.8 Graphical illustration of void creation in PBF",

    "content": "Various studies have applied Taguchi and one-factor-at-atime (OFAT) methods to examine the effect of each processrelated parameter on the mechanical performance of a metal AM part. These studies have shown that the influence of hatching distance and layer thickness on the relative density present the same trend and it is exhibited in Fig. 9a, b correspondingly; the smaller these values are,the higher is the relative density of the fabricated part due to the concentration of the energy density [28, 60, 88]. Moreover, other process-related parameters,such as laser power and scan speed, possess a more complex relationship to the creation of defects in the part's structure.More specifically, depending on the feedstock material, there are optimum printing conditions that result to a maximum relative density [28, 55]. Consequently,as shown in the qualitative diagrams concerning the laser power and scan speed in Fig. 9c, d correspondingly,a plateau is created in which a certain value of the highest relative density could be achieved [62, 88]. According to Ghayoor et al. [55], in case of employing appropriate printing conditions with SS 3O4L as construction material, it is possible to achieve up to $9 9 \\%$ relative density providing remarkable tensile strength. Liverani et al. [91] concluded that a relative density of $9 8 \\%$ coupled with proper build orientation could lead in producing metal AM components with fatigue strength properties close to the reference bulk one. Finally, Georgilas et al.

    "content": "In DED procedures, three process-related parameters affect mainly the mechanical properties of an additively manufactured part.These parameters are the scan speed, the laser power and the feed rate (both for wire-feed or powder-feed).As in the case of the PBF method, the mechanical performance of parts created via DED techniques are affected by their relative density. Combinations of the feed rate and laser power generate defects within the internal structure, such as keyholing and regions with lack of fusion [93]. According to Prasad et al. [3O] high feed rates on powder-feed DED lead in undesired phenomena such as spatter formation and boiling effect resulting to low catchment effciency and increase of porosity. Figure 1O [18] exhibits a detailed map of the relationships between feed rate and defects depending on the heat input for a variety of feedstock materials.In particular, in situations where the feed rate is high, the energy source is unable to completely melt the material resulting in the creation of defects due to lack of fusion phenomena. Contrarily, when the feed rate is low, the material receives an excessive amount of energy which provokes defects due to the keyholing effect. Furthermore, according to Wang et al. [94] and Zhang et al. [95], the reduction of the laser power in DED processes results in an increase of hardness and tensile strength. This enhancement is obtained due to the faster cooling rates of the printed layer, so according to the Hall-Petch formula and the effect of grain boundary strengthening [96, 97], the size of the grains inside the microstructure of the material is refined leading in the improvement of the mechanical properties of the product.",

This practice could be achieved by employing lattice structures for the internal structure of the part,as shown in Fig. 6.However, utilizing these structures could result in a strong reduction of the mechanical properties.According to Gibson et al.

    "content": "Metal AM components are used in highly demanding applications, such as aerospace and automotive, thus it is essential to meet specific requirements regarding their mechanical performance.To accomplish this task, metal AM parts undergo post-processing procedures.The most common procedures are heat treatments (homogenization, aging,annealing),hot isostatic pressing(HIP) and shot peening. In their comprehensive review,Liu and Shin [100] pointed out the necessity of post-processing procedures to minimize the internal defects and enhance the mechanical properties of a Ti6Al4V product using DED or PBF techniques. Moreover, according to Pal et al. [59] and Popovich et al. [101], proper heat treatment (aging, homogenization) enhances both strength properties and hardness.Ma et al. [102] deduced that excessive heat treatment or special heat treatment (annealing) may result in a slight decrease of the tensile properties and hardness;however,it enhances the ductility as well the fatigue properties of the product. Furthermore,the HIP process improves the ductility of the printed objects and enhances the fatigue strength,while also reducing significantly the porosity leading in a noticeable reduction of mechanical anisotropies [39,40,103,104]. Considering the studies of Molaei et al.[1O3] and Sanaei et al. [104], AM parts that undergo post-processing procedures to reduce their surface roughness, such as machining, exhibit increased fatigue and cycling loading strength. This behavior occurs due to the extinction of defects on the surfaces of the part that could lead to a crack initiation. Finally, according to Sanz et al. [38], the post-processing procedure of shot peening could result in a relief of the internal stresses improving that way the mechanical properties of the printed part.",

    "content": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing can fabricate complex metallic products directly from digital models,which is quite superior when compared with other traditional manufacturing techniques,such as machining, casting,and rolling[1].However,defects often exist in the final products of LPBF,which will deteriorate their quality. Balling is a common process-induced defect in LPBF. It represents the phenomenon that the molten pool of a scan track breaks into plenty of individual spherical droplets [2]. It will cause high part porosity and undesired surface roughness, thus has detrimental effects on the mechanical performance of the products.As discussed in[3,4], the onset of balling phenomenon is related to the size and geometry of the molten pool in single tracks.Thus, it is necessary to have a better understanding of the molten pool geometric characteristics including height, width,and contact angle,so that to better infer the occurrence of balling and to optimize the process conditions for the fabrication of balling-free products.\n\nExperimental investigations, numerical simulations, and analytical modeling are three main methods to study the characteristics of LPBF process. Experimental techniques can help the researchers monitor the in situ melting process of the metal powders,observe the formation of processinduced defects,and measure the properties of final products [5-8]. For example,Cunningham et al.[1] observed the formation process of vapor depression depth in LPBF by using a high-speed X-ray image technique.The correlation between vapor depression depth and process conditions was studied. Wang et al. [3] used a roughness meter to measure the roughness of upper layer surface in LPBF and employed",

[9] employed scanning electron microscope (SEM) to investigate the morphology of single scan tracks and microstructure of final products under different process conditions. It was found that the balling tendency has increasing trends with the increase of scan speed and layer thickness.However, it will decrease when the laser power increases.The effects of oxygen content and surface remelting on the balling characteristics were also studied based on the experimental observations. Bertoli et al. [8] also investigated the effects of process conditions on the surface morphology and balling tendency of single scan tracks. The observed sensitivity of balling tendency to laser power and scan speed was consistent with the conclusions in [9]. Guo et al. [10] employed SEM to observe the morphology of the powder material and used optical microscope (OM) to study the surface morphology and wetting characteristics of the single tracks. The discontinuity, humping,and balling behaviors of tracks were observed. The OM was also widely used to observe the geometry of molten pool cross-sections and obtain the information of molten height, width,depth, and contact angle [1O-12]. Although experimental study can help the researchers understand the physics in LPBF process and has provided significant amount of valuable data, the high cost of experimental equipment and complex operations for measurements will hinder the further application of these experimental techniques.",

Tang et al.[14] proposed a computational fluid dynamic-based model for the simulation of melting and solidification in LPBF process. The powder bed packing pattern was also generated by a discrete element method. The mechanism of the formation of porosity was analyzed based on the simulations. Tang et al. [15] also used computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method to simulate the single-track printing in LPBF. The mechanism of humping formation was analyzed, and effects of different forces such as surface tension and recoil pressure on the formation of humping were also discussed.Khairallah et al.[16] developed a three-dimensional model for the simulation of melting process in LPBF. The laser ray-tracing model was included in the simulation process.The formation mechanisms of pores,denudation,and spatter were revealed. Ge et al.

The discontinuity and balling defect in scan tracks were both predicted by the numerical model and the predictions agreed well with the experimental observations.However, the main disadvantage of these numerical models is the low computational efficiency, which will significantly increase the computational cost [14].",

This assumption has been widely adopted in the literature to describe the shape of the cap profile,because it resembles most experimentally observed cap shape in typical conduction melting mode [3, 4].

Documented experimental measurements of In625 [12] are compared to analytical predictions to validate the modeling of molten pool width,height,and contact angle.In [12],a lab-developed LPBF equipment was utilized to conduct multiple single-track experiments, which employed a Quasi-CW Ytterbium fiber laser to melt the $\\mathrm { I n } 6 2 5$ powders.The laser spot diameter was $7 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .

To further verify the predictive accuracy of the proposed analytical method for different materials,the predictions of molten pool width and height are compared with the documented experimental measurements of Ti6Al4V in LPBF [24]. The single-track experiments in [24] were performed by using a Concept Laser M2 LPBF equipment. The laser spot size $( D 4 \\sigma )$ of that equipment was $5 4 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ .

The values of laser absorptivity used in this study have been reported in the literature,as shown in Table 1. The packing densifications of the common powders in LPBF are related to the powder size distribution, and they are usually in the range of 20 to $7 0 \\%$ [12].

    "content": "The comparison between predictions and experimental data of Inconel 625 and Ti6Al4V are shown in Figs.2,3,and 4 and Figs.6 and 7.It can be observed that the predicted results of molten pool width, height, and contact angle all show good agreement with experimental measurements for most cases.For some cases,the deviations between predictions and measurements are big.The occurrence of these deviations can be explained by many reasons because the melting and solidification processes in LPBF are affected by many process parameters.For example,the laser spot size can affect the coefficient of laser absorption and the geometry of vapor depression,which will then affect the formation of molten pool. The content of gas atmosphere in the LPBF equipment will affect the solidification and surface morphology of molten pools [9]. The powder size distribution and packing pattern will affect the powder bed density and material properties,which will then affect the heat transfer during the melting process [27]. Thus,the ignorance of these parameters in the proposed model will induce some deviations to experimental results.Calculated results of width of powder consumed band of $\\mathrm { I n } 6 2 5$ and Ti6Al4V and the predicted results of contact angle of Ti6Al4V are shown in Figs.5,8,and 9, respectively.\n\n![](images/7c338e4236b7c6cb111ccf2eb829c09dbceb6ff6306feecf117c0e2b5d21f798.jpg)  \nFig.8 Predictions of contact angle of Ti6Al4V\n\n![](images/460a86a4a0049ec5e2c04e83098cf75e35c99d1e50a9e4d5f4921fad5b3008d8.jpg)  \nFig.9 Predictions of width of powder consumed band of Ti6Al4V\n\n![](images/5bdc138aeb220f98517d03d38e75e84610d75c45fc0b3b251dad182b5d93b88c.jpg)  \nFig.11 Predictions of contact angle of SS316L",

The experimental observed surface morphologies of SS316L under the same process conditions are shown in Fig.13(Track 1 to 8) and Fig.14 (Track 9 to 11) [9]. From Table 4 and Fig.11, it can be found that the contact angle has a positive relationship with scan speed and a negative relationship with laser power. As discussed in [3], balling defect will not appear when the contact angle is below $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , so the indicator values for Tracks 1,2, 3,4, 10,and 11 are not calculated. When the contact angle is above $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , the stability condition of a scan track needs to be checked to determine whether balling defect will occur. From the calculations in Fig.13,when the scan speed is over $3 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ , the indicator values are negative,which means that the stability conditions are not fulfilled and thus obvious balling will appear in Tracks 6,7,and 8.In the experimental observations shown in Fig.13, the scan track broke into plenty of individual drops when the scan speed was over $3 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ and the number of drops in a scan track showed an increasing trend with the scan speed [9].In other words,balling defect appeared when the scan speed was over $3 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ and the severity of balling increased with the scan speed [9]. Thus,the predictions of balling occurrence for Tracks 1 to 8 are consistent with the experimental observations.For Track 9, the calculated indicator value (O.O8) is positive,which means the stability condition of this track is fulfilled and thus no balling should occur. However,as shown in Fig.14,obvious balling appeared when the laser power was 11O W.",

The molten pool width, molten pool length,and width of powder consumed band are determined by comparing the temperature profle with the melting point of material. The cap of the solidified scan track is assumed to be a segmental cylinder. Based on this assumption and the principle of mass conservation, the molten pool height, contact angle, and diameter of the cylindrical cap are then determined through geometrical relationships,with calculated molten pool width and assumed powder packing densification as inputs. The balling occurrence under various process conditions is then analyzed after checking the stability condition of a segmental cylindrical scan track.",

    "content": "The laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF),also known as selective laser melting (SLM) involves the interaction between the laser heat source and metal powder particles occurring in a layer-by-layer pattern to form a solid part.Although the terms L-PBF and SLM are interchangeably used for the laser process [1-5],we adopt the term L-PBF for our discussions throughout this review.Even though L-PBF seems simple in principle,it involves a highly complex multiphysics phenomenon occurring in the powder bed,in resulting molten pool and in the solidifying phase of the parts.A clear understanding of influence of the various 3D printing parameters on the outcome of the process is essential to build a good quality part.As illustrated in Fig.1 the multitudes of parameters available in the L-PBF process are known to influence the material's structure,and the structure in turn influences the final properties of built part.Hence,these process-structure-property (PSP) relationships must be clearly understood to optimize the process for a defect free part. The major defects that are typically observed in L-PBF parts are porosity and microstructural defects [6-10].",

    "content": "A poorly chosen parameter combination may result in insufficient powder fusion, keyhole formations and balling phenomenon.An illustration in Fig.2 shows the choice of laser power and scanning speed affecting the outcome of process.A high laser speed and insufficient laser power results in insufficient melting of powder leading to lacks-offusion porosity. On the contrary,a choice of too high power for a given speed results in overheating,causing deeper laser penetration, leading to pore formations of inert gas know as keyholes [1O].The deeper penetration due to excessive laser power will also affect the microstructures of already solidified layers.Fig.2 suggests that we can increase both the power and speed within the range of safe operating window for minimum defects.However, increasing the power and speed beyond a certain limit will also lead to an unstable melt pool behavior and formation of small spherical balls known as balling phenomenon which leads to discontinuous melt tracks.\n\nHence,it is imperative to find the optimum process parameters window prior to fabrication; however,due to the vast number of many parameters (more than 1oo [1O]) considered to affect the deposition process,the task of understanding and optimizing all the parameters is extremely challenging.Numerous studies have identified critical parameters such as laser power, scanning speed, hatching spacing, layer thickness and scanning strategies having major influence on properties of the final part.",

Various studies on parameter optimizations focus on transforming α martensite into a $\\alpha + \\beta$ structure to improve its mechanical properties.Also,review by Zhang etal.[12] on Al alloys byL-PBF highlighted the difficulties in laser formability of Al alloys comparison to Ti and Fe alloys as Al alloys have high laser reflectivity $( { \\sim } 9 1 \\% )$ and high thermal conductivity (237 $W / \\mathrm { m K } )$ which results in high cooling rate leading to cracking.However, these reviews do not consider the numerical modeling approaches which play an important role in L-PBF parameter optimizations studies.The 316L stainless steel is widely used in industries and is the most feasible material for L-PBF process due its high weldability compared to Ti and Al alloys.A comprehensive review on L-PBF parameter optimization covering both the experimental and numerical work specific to SS316L material is rare to be found.Hence,this paper provides a review of the literature with the objective to attain high densifications,high mechanical properties (strength and ductility) and microstructural morphologies in SS3l6L material.A brief work carried outby the authors on simulation approach for investigating L-PBF process parameters to attain high densification in SS316L steel specimens is also included in the numerical modeling section.",

    "content": "A comprehensive investigation on interaction of the process parameters and its effect on densification is imperative to produce high quality parts.One such work carrying out full factorial permutation involving laser power, scanning speed,and hatch spacing was done by Yakout et al.[8].Using the influence of energy density on resulting densification in L-PBF, Yakout successfully established range of energy densities ilustrated in Fig.4 (a) which results in stable melting, continuous beads,and uniform melt tracks. Lower values of laser energy density showed significant porosity due to formation of voids and lack of powder fusion,and the higher energy density values beyond a certain limit resulted in decreasing densification leading to unstable melt pool, vaporization,and micro-segregation of alloying elements.This can also be well understood from the observations made from the fractography of SS316L specimens built with various laser energy density values as shown in Fig.4 (b),(i) Brittle fracture observed in specimen build with lower energy density value of $4 1 . 7 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m ^ { 3 } }$ due large number of voids present (ii) Britle-ductile failure observed in specimen built with energy density value of $6 2 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m ^ { 3 } }$ shows lesser voids present in comparison with specimen built with lower value (i) Ductile failure observed in specimen built with higher energy density value of $1 5 6 . 3 \\mathrm { J / m m } ^ { 3 }$ shows mass vaporization of the metal.Hence,the determination of appropriate energy density range becomes vital for achieving parts with minimum porosity defects.\n\n![](images/dd0df0677911684ec73b874f43d9136a92ab9886091c7f163fdafc7d8315970f.jpg)  \nFig.2.Influence of laser power and scanning velocity on the build outcome.",

    "content": "Wang et al.[55] emphasized the need for selection of a process parameter that results in refined cellular dendrites which leads to high mechanical strength.The influence of energy density by varying scan speeds on dendrite spacing was studied and optimal values above $1 2 5 J /$ $\\mathrm { { \\bar { m } m ^ { 3 } } }$ which resulted in small dendrite spacing and no residual pores was determined.The small cell spacing is due to the high cooling rate associated with high scanning speeds that shortens the time available for dendrite coarsening.The hardness and tensile properties of the parts were found to be superior compared to traditional wrought SS316L. Zhong et.al [43] in his study also found increases in strength of L-PBF parts compared with traditional counterparts,the reason is attributed to the combined effect of intragranular cellular segregation network structure and by the pinning effect of dislocations due to the small cell spacing which resists deformations.The decrease in cell spacing with increase in range of laser scanning speed was also confirmed by Yadroitsev et.al [56],suggesting scanning speed is more suitable parameter for controlling microstructure evolution in L-PBF process. Other strategies such as remelting of previous formed layer to attain homogenous microstructure have been used by Kruth et al.[2O] and Yasa et al.[28].A comparison shown in Fig.17 indicates the remelting of layers leads to a significantly finer lamellar microstructure without any pores compared to microstructure without layer remelting.\n\nNumerical modeling has also been used to reduce the experimental effort to investigate the microstructures.The numerical models predict the melt pool characteristics and thermal behaviors during the process and relate the influence of L-PBF parameters on microstructure.\n\n![](images/723eb044c24ee8ba90eae3b8790d238e5a33906240b48e11c542d76b93ece6e8.jpg)  \nFig9.Fioeecepof predicted melt pool depth(right) [63].",

    "content": "Aggarwal et al.[58] in their work studied the effect of different melting modes (conduction and keyhole) on the microstructure of 316L parts fabricated from L-PBF.The different melting modes are attained by altering the laser intensity and the mesoscale model developed predicted accurately the melt pool geometries considering the spatial arrangements and phase transition of powder particles.The experimental investigation of the samples revealed that the keyhole mode resulted in finer cellular grains with mean cellular spacing decreasing from about $0 . 4 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ to $0 . 2 8 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ compared to that with conduction mode,the refinement of grains is attributed to the remelting of the previously deposited layers and increased cooling rates due to the surrounding solidified bulk material. Similarly,Liu etal.[57] in their study used FE models to study the influence of subsequent thermal cycling on the microstructure using a single and a three layer numerical model. The numerical model successfully predicted the melting track dimensions and thermal behaviors for the L-PBF samples.The microstructure investigation shown in Fig.18 on the individual layers revealed that the grain size in single layer sample was finer and uniform compared to the three-layer sample due to the faster heat dissipation to the solid substrate.However,in the three-layer sample there was variation in microstructure along the height of the build with a smaller grain size found in the topmost (third layer) compared to the finer grains in second and first layers below.The first and second layer undergoes reheating and hence subjected to greater thermal gradients compared with third layer.Although,the third layer does not undergo subsequent thermal cycling the grains size is much larger compared to the single layer sample due to elongated heat flow paths.",

Currently, other types of porosities from keyhole formations and balling effects are not predicted in this FEM module. In order to filter out power/speed combinations that produce unstable melt pools and unfit for attaining high densifications,a dimensional criteria based on melt pool dimensions is adopted [68].Fig.21 shows the melt pool dimensions used in criteria, the median depth $( d )$ refers to the actual melt pool depth minus the layer thickness,or the melt pool depth starting from the bottom of the first layer. Similarly,the median width (w) and median length $( l )$ refer to the width and length of the melt pool at the bottom of the first layer (the start of the substrate) respectively.The median dimensions are preferred instead of the average melt pool dimensions as the average values are skewed at the beginning of track when the melt pool is not entirely stable. The suggested criteria's is based on following three conditions: (i) the median melt pool depth $( d )$ should reach at least halfway through the third solidified layer below for sufficient bonding, since our layer thickness is $4 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ $\\left( 0 . 0 4 ~ \\mathrm { m m } \\right)$ ,we need the melt pool depth of at least $0 . 1 \\mathrm { m m }$ ,which corresponds to median melt pool depth of $0 .",

The mathematical concepts and detailed comparison of the methods has been extensively discussed in the following literatures [69-72].MC methods is a popular method already being used for prediction of grain evolution in casting [73,74],welding [75,76] and sintering process [77,78].This concept of MC methods also has been extended to laser additive manufacturing as well. Sun et al.[45] conducted kinetic MC simulations using open-source code Stochastic Parallel Particle Kinetic Simulator to determine the influence of melt pool dimensions on resulting crystallographic orientation of SS316L.The work showed that desired crystallographic orientations can be successfully achieved by optimizing the melt pool dimensions using high laser power $( 4 0 0 W )$ and multi scanning strategy.Based on the simulation approach,itis reported that shallow melt pool promotes the formation of (Ool crystallographic orientation which are typical of L-PBF process,while a short and deep melt pool favors a fine grain microstructure with $\\langle 0 1 1 \\rangle$ crystallographic orientation which enhances the tensile strength as well as ductility of the 316L specimens.",

It is found that primary process parameters suchas laser power, scanning speed,hatch spacing,layer thickness and scanning patterns have been extensively utilized to arrive on the optimum energy density range to get highest build density.It is also understood that complete or $1 0 0 \\%$ densification is rather difficult to achieve due to formation of gas pores at high temperatures and cannot be controlled merely by process parameters,nevertheless the overall defects may be minimized by using appropriate process parameter combination.We also observed that L-PBF process has been used to overcome the strength and ductility trade off limitation of the traditional manufacturing due to the flexibility offered by L-PBF process parameters to control the resulting microstructure thereby enhancing the mechanical properties.The review also observed that studies involving process parameter optimization makes extensive use of numerical modeling and computer simulation techniques to study combined effect of process parameters on build quality which are rather dificult to be accomplished by experiments.The advanced numerical modeling techniques at both micro and meso level helps to establish process-structureproperty relations for the L-PBF process.However,it is found that there is dearth of work on computational material modeling predicting microstructures of SS316L material from L-PBF process and large-scale modeling is rare to find due to the significantly high computational cost.These areas are being currently pursued as an important topic of research.",

    "content": "Understanding the esential role of initial powder bed states (e.g.,structure and temperature) in the printing process is crucial to obtain high-quality components in powder-bed-based aditive manufacturing.In this article, a 3D high-fidelity model which considered the Marangoni efects and recoil pressure was established based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach to simulate the printing process of $3 1 6 \\mathrm { ~ L ~ }$ stainless steel through selective laser melting (SLM).The influences of powder bed structure and temperature on the macroand microscopic characteristics of the molten layer during printing were comprehensively investigated.On this basis,corresponding mechanisms were analyzed. Results show that the developed numerical model can vividly reproduce the SLM process of $^ { 3 1 6 \\mathrm { ~ L ~ } }$ stainless steel.With the increase of powder bed thickness from $3 2 . 0 2 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ $( H _ { \\mathrm { { s p r e a d i n g } } } { = } 2 ~ D 9 0$ and $V _ { \\mathrm { s p r e a d i n g } } { = } 0 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m } / s ,$ to $4 0 . 6 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ $( H _ { \\mathrm { s p r e a d i n g } } { = } 2 D ^ { \\mathsf { C } }$ 90and $V _ { \\mathrm { s p r e a d i n g } } { = } 0 . 0 1 \\ \\mathrm { m } / s )$ ,the height of the molten layer will increase from 16.37 to $3 2 . 8 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,the depth will decrease from $2 1 . 6 9 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $1 0 . 5 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ and the width will decrease from 100.67 to $9 4 . 9 4 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ Meanwhile,this will make the fluctuation of the depth (CV) increase from O.31 to O.85.When the initial temperature increases from $3 0 0 \\mathrm { K }$ to $7 7 3 . 1 5 \\mathrm { K }$ ,the height, depth and width of the molten layer increase by $3 . 8 8 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ $1 2 . 6 8 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ and $1 7 . 3 7 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ ,respectively.In this case,the CV is reduced from 0.34 to 0.23,implying the improvement of the molten layer quality.",

    "content": "Currently,understanding the physical mechanisms and microscopic behaviors during SLM is always the researchers'main concern. Some researchers directly observed and investigated the complex molten pool variations or pore behaviors during the melting process through physical experiments by using high-energy X-ray imaging technology [9-12]. Even though the physical experiments are very intuitive and straightforward, the unavoidable disadvantages (e.g.,expensive devices, laborious operations, and difficulties for in-situ monitoring/characterization) restricted its further development 13].In comparison,numerical simulation is an appropriate alternative to overcome the problems in physical experiments because it can easily capture the dynamic information during printing from particulate scale and provide valuable solutions for actual process through optimization of results from systematic parametric studies.For example,Khairallah et al.[14] built a three-dimensional powder-scale model to reveal the mechanism of pore defects,material spattering (sparking),and denudation zones.Bayat et al. [8] analyzed the formation,evolution and disappearance of keyhole and keyhole-induced porosities along with their initiating mechanisms,during single track laser-based powder bed fusion.Wei etal.[4] studied the formation and evolution of inter-track voids in different heat input conditions.Khairallah etal.[1] discovered new spatter-induced defect formation mechanisms that depend on the scan strategy and competition between laser shadowing and expulsion. Gu et al.[15] investigated various phenomena including balling effect, keyhole depression,and insufficient fusion between layers are investigated with different laser energy inputs.Li et al.[16] analyzed the keyhole life cycle including formation and drilling,fluctuation,and disappearance.",

    "content": "The variations in macro- and microscopic behaviors during melting are closely related to the process of SLM.Hence,researchers have conducted extensive researches on laser processing (i.e.,the effects of operating factors on the melting process).In this aspect, Gao et al.[17] discussed the effect of non-spherical particles on packing density, molten pool dynamics and melt track dimensions.Cao [18] investigated the influences of particle size distribution,powder bed compactness,and lamination thickness on SLM single-pass formation. And the influence of energy density on the single track formation and porosity development was investigated in detail [19-21].Gu et al.[22] discussed the influence of powder particle size on the melting and solidification characteristics of selective laser melting.It has been evidenced that the powder bed state has a great influence on the subsequent molten pool behavior and the properties of the final parts [23-25],while the essential role of the initial state (i.e.,initial structural state and temperature) of the powder bed in the subsequent melting process is not clear enough. Especially for the SLM 3D printing of 316 L stainless steel (abbreviated by 316 L) powder,much less work in this regard was found. Generally,following problems or research gaps are still existed and yet to be solved: (1) How do the initial structure and temperature of the powder beds affect the macro-and microscopic characteristics (including formation and prediction of defects) of the molten layer? (2) What is the quantitative correlation between them?(3) What are the underlying mechanisms? (4) What is the best resolution for improvement?",

Firstly,the spreading of $3 1 6 \\mathrm { ~ L ~ }$ powder was realized and visualized by discrete element method (DEM) used in our previous work [26,27]. Then,a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that considering the Marangoni effects and recoil pressure was established and validated to simulate the melting process of each powder layer. On this basis, the influences of powder bed structure and temperature on the macroscopic morphology (i.e.,width,height,and depth of each molten track) and microscopic behavior (i.e.,defects) of the molten layer were systematicallyinvestigated.Finally,the underlying mechanisms were analyzed and corresponding solutions were provided.The obtained highlighted results are of paramount theoretical and practical significance for in-depth insights on the melting process of SLM 3D printing and improving the quality of the molten layer as well as the performance of final products.",

    "content": "From Fig.4(a) one can find that when the powder bed is thick (e.g., powder bed 1),the shape of the molten layer fluctuates significantly, and the height and depth of the molten pool vary obviously.The entire molten layer can even be divided into three separate sections,and many parts are not melted [18].When the thickness of the powder bed is moderate (e.g.,powder beds 3 and 4),the morphology of the molten layeris not seriously fluctuated,and the internal pores are not likely to occur.When the powder bed is very thin and the number of particles is small(e.g.,powder bed 5),the fluctuation of the molten layer increases slightly,which is caused by the large difference of powder bed quality in early spreading stage [26].Moreover,due to the large cavities formed between particles in the powder bed,the laser even directly acts on the substrate,which reduces the utilization rate of energy to a certain extent [22].Accordingly,the variations of molten layer characteristics can be quantitatively reflected in Figs. 5(a)-(c). As can be seen that increasing the powder bed thickness from $3 2 . 0 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $4 0 . 6 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ can increase the molten layer height from $1 6 . 3 7 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $3 2 . 8 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .The thick powder layer will make it difficult for the laser energy to penetrate and transfer to the lower region; in this case,most of the melted part is from the powder layerabove the substrate[18],resulting ina higher heightof the molten layer.In addition,the depth of the molten layer from thick powder bed also becomes smaller due to the small energy transfer.For example, the molten layer depth of powder bed1is only $1 0 . 5 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .In comparison,the powder bed structure has litte efect on the width of the molten layer.",

    "content": "where $X _ { \\mathrm { s t } }$ is the standard deviation of $X$ and $\\overline { { X } }$ is the average value. $X$ represents the molten pool height,depth and width,respectively.A larger CV indicates the more serious fluctuation of the molten layer. The fluctuations of CV in Figs.5(a)-(c) indicate that increasing powder bed thickness will result in a decrease of the $C V$ of molten layer depth from 0.85 to O.31,implying a more uniform depth evolution.The upper surface of the molten layer is significantly affected by the powder bed structure.The fluctuation of the upper surface is extremely complicated due to the complexity of the structure.In addition,the height of the molten layer increases with powder bed thickness.Therefore,the CV of the molten layer height does not show obvious trend, so as to the CV of the molten layer width.For the molten layer depth,when the thickness of the powder bed is reduced (from Powder beds 1 to 4),the powder bed is decreased from 3-4 layers of particles to one layer of particles.The energy transfer path changes from the particle-particle-substrate mode to a simple particle-substrate mode.Complex particle-particle contacts result in high molten layer depth fluctuations for thick powder beds. Therefore,the CV of the molten layer depth becomes smaller with the decrease of the powder bed thickness.As the powder bed becomes thinner (Powder bed 5),the involved cavities between the particles become larger;in this case,the particle distribution becomes more uneven,which leads to the increase of the CV of the molten layer depth. Combining with Fig.4(a),one can find that the quality of the molten layer of powder bed 4is more optimal under current laser conditions. Therefore,powder bed 4is selected for investigating the influence of powder bed temperature in the following sections.",

    "content": "Fig.4(b) shows the macroscopic morphologies of molten layers obtained from different initial temperatures.As indicated that no obvious defects can be observed in each molten layer.With the increase of initial temperature,the area (red region in Fig.4(c)) of the molten layer expands obviously.From the average values in Figs.5(d)-(f),one can find that when the initial temperature increases from $3 0 0 \\mathrm { K }$ to 773.15K, the height, depth and width of the molten layer are increased by $3 . 8 8 ~  { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ $1 2 . 6 8 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and $1 7 . 3 7 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,respectively,which can be inextricably linked with the conclusion in Fig.A3(b) in Appendix.A high initial temperature can increase the energy contained in the molten pool so that the maximum temperature therein will be increased [41],which will increase the melted particles and substrate area [25].From the CV evolution in Figs.5(d)-(f),one can find similar effect as the powder bed structure;i.e.,only the effects of initial temperature on the molten pool depth are monotonic.Here,the CV of the molten pool depth decreases from 0.34 to 0.23 with the increase of the initial temperature,indicating that the fluctuation of the depth becomes smaller and the quality of the molten layer becomes better.Under the same initial structure,the shapes of the molten layers obtained from different temperatures are basically similar.However, the incrementof the molten pool at diferent parts caused by the high initial temperature is not consistent due to the complexity of the powder bed structures.Therefore,the CV of the molten layer height and width does not show obvious monotonic trend. For the depth of the molten layer,the high thermal conductivity caused by the high initial temperature reduces the heat difference between different parts,and the fluctuation of the molten depth caused by the powder bed is reduced,so the CVof the molten layer depth decreases.",

Clearly,there are many defects in the molten layer when the initial temperature is $3 0 0 \\mathrm { K } ,$ where the typical features are mainly located in the three positions“i-ii\" marked by the dotted box.The formation process of these microscopic defects isanalyzed in detail,as depicted in Figs.6(b)-(d).It is worth mentioning that the red and black dashed circles in the figure are the initial and final states of the selected key analysis zones.And the corresponding positions are marked with yellow arrows to describe the evolution of the molten pool conveniently in this duration.From Fig.6 (b) one can find that when the laser is irradiated on the surface of the powder bed $\\left( 0 . 0 0 { - } 0 . 0 3 \\mathrm { m s } \\right)$ ,the top particles are melted rapidly.At this moment, the energy of the laser cannot be transferred to the downward particles,which makes them not properly melted.At $0 . 0 6 \\mathrm { m s }$ ,the central region of the laser shifts to the right and part of the lower particles are melted due to the energy transfer.When the laser moves away from this position $( 0 . 1 2 \\mathrm { - } 0 . 1 5 \\mathrm { m } s )$ ,the molten pool gradually cools.At $0 . 1 8 \\mathrm { m s }$ it is completely solidified and a special-shaped “edge warping\"structure is formed.Similar features can be observed in others’work [43].The initial position of the laser scanning path and the thick powder bed are the main reasons for this phenomenon.The laser action time in the initial position is shorter than that on the powder in other parts,so the input energy is less.",

The unmelted substrate results in worse connection between the front and rear molten metal liquid.In addition,the melted metal tends to aggregate together to form balling due to the surface tension rather than uniformly spread on the substrate [32,44].Therefore,a discontinued structure of the molten layer appears here at $0 . 4 8 \\mathrm { m s }$ .The molten pool behavior in Fig.6(d) is similar to that in Fig.6(c).The difference lies in that the defect is caused by large particles.The target large particle is gradually melted during the laser scanning (O.54-0.63 ms).The substrate below the large particle is not melted,so the discontinuity and balling defects occur here [18,22].Additionally, pores are formed either,which is also caused by the larger upper particles and their impedance on laser penetration [45].",

One can find that the entrained bubbles and pores are distinctly reduced at high initial temperature.The high initial temperature slows down the solidification rate of the molten pool,allowing more time for the bubbles to escape [7].This is the main reason for the reduction of entrained bubbles.Also,large energy input can contribute to the reduction of pores in Fig.7(c).",

The junction between the two molten layers isat the edge of the laser energy,and the temperature in this region is lower [4,48].

The high initial temperature can reduce or even eliminate these defects to a certain extent. During the melting process of the thin powder bed， new defect (e.g., entrained bubbles) may appear,which can also be reduced by the high initial temperature.It should be noted that special grooves will be formed in the molten layer due to excessive energy input.During the 6-track melting process,the surface roughness,the irregularity of the molten layer,and the pores between layers due to insufficient energy are likely to occur.A high initial temperature can significantly improve the surface quality of the molten layer and reduce the pores between layers. 5.When the laser power is $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { W }$ ,the scanning velocity is $_ { 1 \\textrm { m } / s }$ ,and the laser size is $8 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,the best molten layer quality can be obtained by using powder bed 4 (i.e., $H _ { \\mathrm { s p r e a d i n g } } { = } 2 D 9 0$ and $V _ { \\mathrm { s p r e a d i n g } } { = } 0 . 1 5 \\mathrm { m } /$ s)as the initial powder bed structure.The initial temperature of $7 7 3 . 1 5 \\mathrm { K }$ can significantly improve the quality of the molten layer.\n\nThese new findings can further enhance the insight into powder melting process,which will not only reveal the powder melting regimes from particulate scale,but also provide valuable references for the selection of process parameters and process optimization in the real AM process.",

It utilizes flexible powder sheets as the feedstock material,which are composed of metal powder-polymer binder composites.The printability of MMS by MAPS is assssed through the fabrication of three-phase SS304-IN718-Ss304 composites with increased geometric dimensions on the S316 baseplates.The effects of part size on the evolution of the meltpool morphologyand the formation of defects during MAPS are investigated by experimental characterizations and computational modeling.The results show that when fabricating larger MMs,the use of alonger scanvector easily leads todefects suchas lack-of-fusion porosity,ballingand cracks.This is due to the longer duration of inter-hatch cooling time,the reduced amount of thermal accumulation and the higher degree of residual streses.By adopting an island scanning strategy,a defect-free large-size MMS with variationsof chemical composition, microstructure and microhardness is successfully printed by MAPs.The proposed MAPS method offers a new solution for producing high-quality MMs.",

    "content": "Multi-material structures (MMS) are characterized by spatial variations in materials and thus vary in their functionality and characteristic properties along the thickness or length direction [1-3]. This is contrary to homogeneous single-material components.As a revolutionary and novel composite material,MMS is of great interest in a variety of industrial applications,including the aerospace,biomedical and automobile sectors [4-6].For the wider uptake of MMS,many advanced manufacturing methods have been developed.Wang et al.[7] synthesized multilayer composite Ti/TiN coatings with different composite periods by a plasma-enhanced ion plating technique.Feng et al.[8] achieved a functionally graded WC-Co/Ni composite and 41O stainless steel via diffusion bonding.However, these conventional techniques are typically used for the preparation of thin films,limiting the design freedom and size of MMS.",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM) of MMS has attracted extensive attention due to its capabilities to fabricate arbitrarily complex geometries or customized components [9-l2].As one of the most commonly used AM methods,directed energy deposition (DED) has become an important approach for manufacturing metallic MMS parts due to its convenience in changing the feedstock materials [13-16]. Shan et al. numerically and experimentally investigated the effect of the composition gradient on the mechanical behavior of DED-processed MMS composed of austenitic and ferritic steels [17].Li et al.established a multi-physics,multi-material thermal fluid model and predicted the material composition gradients and the geometry of SS316/IN718 MMs during the DED fabrication process.This work was also experimentally validated [18].Adomako et al.explored the influence of the deposition sequence of different materials and the laser power on the multi-layered materials of Ti6Al4V,vanadium and $1 7 { - } 4 \\mathrm { P H }$ stainless steel in DED[19]. Although it demonstrates a high deposition efficiency,DED fails to manufacture complex structures with fine features due to its low fabrication accuracy (i.e.spatial resolution) [20].\n\nSheet lamination or laminated object manufacturing (LOM) is a method for MMS by bonding metal foils feedstock using techniques such as laser,electron beam,or ultrasonics [2l-23]. Obielodan et al. fabricated Ti/Al3003 composites using LOM and a $6 1 . 7 7 \\ \\%$ increase in the load capability was experimentally measured on the dual-material structure compared to thatof the single Al3oo3 material [24].However,LOMhas limitations,as it requires an additional milling tool or laser to cut the feedstock into the desired geometry at each layer and difficulties in recycling the removed material.In addition,LOMis limited to fabricating 2D MMS with the material transitions along only the build direction [25].",

    "content": "Unlike DED or LOM,the selective laser melting (SLM) technique enables the fabrication of high-precision metal components because it employs a finely focused laser beam (e.g.diameter of ${ \\sim } 1 0 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ asthe heat source [26-28].However,most of the currently commercialized SLM systems are specifically designed for printing single-material components;printing MMS by SLM has not been widely investigated or implemented thus far [29-31].\n\nWith the urgent demand for complex MMS,new SLM methods for manufacturing MMS are being developed rapidly.Wei etal.developed a roller-assisted multiple powders feeding system for building multiple metallic materials including 316L stainless steel (SS316),IN718 Nibased alloy and $\\operatorname { C u l 0 5 n }$ copper alloy in a single SLM printer [32]. Wen et al.invented a powder-feeding method by dividing spaces for feeding different metal particles and achieved the SLM fabrication of large-scale CoCrMo-IN718 components with variations of mechanical properties and chemical compositions [33].Wang et al.printed a layered TiB2/Ti6Al4V biological structure using a multi-material SLM platform where different materials are fed via separate grooves [34].\n\nEven though these newly developed SLM systems can be used to accomplish the manufacturing of MMs,it is challenging to separate different powder particles for recycling after the SLMbuild-up [35-37]. Moreover,a long pause is often required for the replacement of material from one powder to another[35].Therefore,one of the key objectives of this work is to develop a new SLM technique for printing MMS with a maximum material utilization,a lower risk of cross-contamination of feedstock materials and improved productivity.",

    "content": "Regarding the SLM printing of MMs,the inter-process parameters involved are considered to primarily affect the quality and in-service performance of the final metal depositions.For instance,when two distinct metallic powders are used to fabricate sandwich-like MMS,the dissimilarmaterial properties,especiallyat their interface,can yielda more complex fusion zone (e.g.a different melt-pool morphology) and a more intense mechanical response (e.g.a larger residual stresses), compared to the deposition of single-material [38,39].Therefore, the fabrication of MMS is prone to generate undesirable defects such as lack of fusion (LOF),balling,porosity and cracks,hereby weakening the bonding strength between two materials [30,40,41].However, these potential defects may be reduced or eliminated by optimizing the process parameters such as the energy density of the laser input, the scanning sequence,or the geometry of MMS [41-43].For example,Chen et al.investigated the formation of interfacial defects between SS316L and CuSnlO and found that depositing copper on steel results in reduced cracking compared to the reverse deposition sequence [44].Even so, more efforts need to be devoted to investigating the effect of the AM variables,such as the inter-hatch cooling time (i.e.the time interval after finishing the fabrication of a hatch,prior to the manufacturing of the next hatch),since they are responsible for the temperature evolution and the final performance of MMs.",

    "content": "To provide some guidance for practical SLM printing and process optimization, the scientific community is developing computational tools to model the thermo-mechanical evolution of MMS.Gu et al. developed a multi-physics modelling framework for predicting the evolution of the melt-pool and the formation of tracks in multi-track, multi-layer and multi-material SLM[45].Using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation, Tan et al.predicted the thermal behavior and velocity field of the melt-pool at the interfacial zone during SLMof 300 maraging steel on bulk 4Crl3 stainless steel [2].Also,Yao et al. investigated the physical mechanism of mixing elements caused by circulating flow with CFD [46].The results showed that the prediction of building MMS is more challenging than simulating the deposition of single-material, due to the heterogeneous property structures that are intrinsic to MMS.\n\nSteel-nickel alloy is an increasingly attractive advanced material that has advantages in obtaining MMS with remarkable property-blending capabilities,well-suited for demanding environments characterized by high temperatures and corrosive conditions.Its applications include power plant,aerospace,and oil refining [47,48].\n\nIn this study,an innovative printing technology, namely,Metal Additive Manufacturing using Powder Sheets (MAPS),is developed for printing MMS parts.To assess the printability of MAPS,a number of investigations are carried out.Firstly,three MMS parts of 3o4L stainless steel (SS304)-IN718-SS304 with increased deposition size are printed by using a $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ rotation scanning pattern.Secondly,the formation mechanisms of different defects (i.e.LOF,porosity,balling and crack) are systematically analyzed by experimental characterizations in conjunction with thermo-mechanical simulations.Lastly,a large-scale defectfree MMS part is completely manufactured and characterized by using the optimum MAPS process configurations.",

    "content": "Fig.1 shows the powder sheet fabrication process and the workflow of the proposed MAPS method [49].MAPS is a modified AM process that combines concepts of both SLM and LOM.Different from the currently commercialized SLM systems that use loose metal powder as the raw material,MAPS adoptsa flexible powder sheetas feedstock.Herein,the metal particles are tightly connected together by the polymer binder while maintaining flexibility of the powder sheet,hence allowing its incorporation with the material roller distribution system.When the laser beam is activated,the polymer binder is evaporated as the temperature surpasses its boiling point (e.g.PCL of $2 3 7 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ,while the metal powder is sintered.Hence,no debinding process is required during the MAPS process.\n\nThe MAPS for MMS operates according to the following procedure: (i)A thin powder sheet,which is tightened to remain flat,is firstly placed on the substrate by rotating the rollers (Fig.1). (i) A high-energy laser beam traces out the specific cross-section of the designed geometry according to the user-defined scanning sequence.(iii) The fabrication platform is lowered to fit a new piece of powder sheet for the next layer. (iv) The steps (i)-(ii) are repeated until completion of the multi-layer deposition of the first material (e.g. SS3o4). (v) For the deposition of the second material,the current powder sheet is removed from the rollers and the new rolled material is replaced.After this,the printing chamber is purged until the oxygen level is below $0 . 2 ~ \\%$ for the MAPS printing.(vi) The above processes (i)-(v) are repeated until finishing the build-up of the entire MMS.\n\n![](images/857e7a7ff19204b870b7199a8597aa93549dfb103069e782f2101cb77337cff7.jpg)  \nFig.1.Illustration of the powder sheet fabrication process (a) and the workflow of MAPS (b).\n\nCompared to the traditional SLM technique, the crucial advantages of the MAPS manufacturing of MMS are as follows.",

During MAPS of MMS,three square SS304 blocks,each of a 2O-layer thickness,are firstly deposited on the same SS3l6 substrate using a $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ rotation scanning strategy.Next,a 2O-layer IN718 matrix at the middle section and another 2O-layer SS3o4 at the top section are printed sequentially.In MAPS,the transition from finishing the printing of the first material to beginning the printing of the secondary material takes a $1 0 { \\cdot } \\mathrm { m i n }$ interval.

The end result is three 60-layer sandwich-like MMS parts being printed,as shown in Fig. 5a.\n\nIt can be seen from Fig.5a that using the $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ rotation scanning strategy generates a relatively smooth top surface of the small (Case-1) and medium (Case-2) MMS samples,but a poor surface quality is obtained for the large MMS sample (Case-3).For comparative purposes and in an effort to optimize the MAPS printing process,an island scanning strategy with a $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ staggered rotation (Fig.4d) is used to re-print the large-scale MMS sample (Case-4),as shown in Fig.5b.",

In this work,different lengths of the scan-vector are used for printing the three different-sized MMS components,although each component is otherwise manufactured under the same printing conditions (Fig. 4a-c). This is assumed to be the reason for the generation of LOF and balling defects during the MAPS process.To assess this and to avoid the remelting effect of multi-layer deposition on the observation and measurement of the melt-pool, three new single-layer SS304 samples with increased horizontal dimensions of $5 \\times 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ $1 0 \\times 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ and $2 0 \\times 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m ^ { 2 } }$ are manufactured on SS316 substrate by MAPS with the $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ rotation scanning strategy (Fig.4a-c).This approach is the same as that which was carried out for the previous multi-layer MMS parts (Fig.5).\n\nThe printed single-layer specimens are sectioned firstly along the center of the build.The obtained cross-sections,which are perpendicular to the scanning direction,are presented in Fig.13a-c.The profile of the melt-pool and the overlapping between adjoining tracks are plainly visible.On the right side of these figures,the melt-pool morphologies predicted byFE thermal analysisare also displayed.Fig.13d compares the predicted and measured width and depth of the melt-pool for the three cases.A noticeable agreement between simulations and experiments is achieved.Once calibrated,the computational model is employed to analyze the thermo-mechanical behavior during the MAPS process of multi-layer MMS.",

One strategy is to utilize a relatively higher energy density to increase both the size and the wettability of the melt-pool.However,this may cause higher residual stresses and potential warping and cracking.This is explained by the fact that,the larger the melt-pool dimensions are,the more significant are the thermal deformations [67].An alternative feasible solution is to optimize the scanning strategy by shortening the length of scan-vector, as used in MAPS of the small MMS part (Case-1).According to this, the MAPS fabrication of a large-scale $( 2 0 \\times 2 0 \\times 1 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 } )$ MMS part is accompanied by adopting an optimized island scanning strategy,as shown in Fig.5b.The metallurgical quality of both the single-phase matrices and CGZ is remarkable (Fig.9d), thanks to achieving sufficient heat accumulation during the MAPS printing (see Fig.14d).",

    "content": "In this section,the formation of cracks observed in the moderate and large MMS (Fig.9b and c) is numerically investigated by the FE structural analysis.These cracks are induced by the intrinsic thermal stresses occurring during the MAPS process for MMS.A previous study has illustrated that both large thermal gradients and the strong mechanical constraints from stiff substrates (or previously deposited layers) in AM are responsible for the formation of residual stress [68].However, the unique characteristics of both the composite materials and the MAPS technique used in this work significantly increase the complexity of the mechanical response.\n\nTherefore,the MAPS printing process of MMS is numerically simulated to further comprehend the generation of the residual stresses. Fig.15 compares the evolution of the Von Mises stresses at three different building heights in the center of the MMS builds.With the increase of the MMS size,the Von Mises stresses pronouncedly increase, which proves that the size effect plays a crucial role in the mechanical behavior of MMS.This is because the larger the structure is in size, the longer the inter-hatch cooling time will be.This results in a reduction of thermal accumulation,consequently contributing to higher thermal stresses and cracks in the as-built MMS parts (Fig.9b and c).\n\nNevertheless，when the island scanning strategy isused for manufacturing the large-scale MMS part, the residual stresses at the center of the build are mitigated (Fig.15c and d).",

This is especially the case at the middle IN718 layers due to their high yield stress.These results are in line with the previous SLM report [69].\n\nRemarkably, the use of island scanning with a $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ staggered rotation disrupts the continuity of the residual stress distribution,which effectively mitigates stress concentration,as shown in Fig.16d.Although the resulting stress reduction is limited (e.g. ${ \\sim } 1 0 ~ \\% )$ ,this strategy successfully prevents the occurrence of cracking defects.This is largely due to the elimination of metallurgical defects,which are typically the most susceptible areas for crack initiation under high thermal stresses.\n\n![](images/0d6f12ab8d77807eeb58be0e2bb8bf66c7e3ee726b2dc344cdfb7ad60c4a4e3e.jpg)  \nFig15.volutsreatephtsineetof:as;(e;(;(4\n\n![](images/3242ca8fb553598656e561395942ba459dd4510e7c95e2f547c5f4847b7c3e1b.jpg)  \nFig.16.Residual von Mises stresses of different MMS parts: (a) Case-l; (b) Case-2; (c) Case-3;(d) Case-4.\n\n![](images/77dea88b5f344cfc8f59795de6c867c8653db48ac5ef08490b8b9734fa2d2ef3.jpg)  \nFig.17.Residual Von Mises stresses along the building direction in the center of the MMS builds (Fig.16a).",

This is because as the part size increases, the inter-hatch cooling time and heat loss also increase,leading to a reduction in the size of the melt-pool and thus to the generation of defects.   \n3) The predicted thermo-mechanical results of MMS illustrate that a large residual stress concentration occurs at the interface of dissimilar matrices.The larger the MMS deposition, the higher both the residual stresses and the risk of cracking (mechanical defects) are. Specifically,the longer scan-vector used for building larger MMS results in larger residual stresses.   \n4) Based on the experimental and numerical analyses,an island scanning strategy is proposed for preventing both metallurgical and mechanical defects.By using the optimized process parameters,a large-scale defect-free SS304-IN718-SS304 MMS component is successfully printed by MAPS.Variations in chemical composition, microhardness and microstructure along the build direction and a good interfacial metallurgical bonding are achieved in the MAPSprocessed MMS part.",

    "content": "# ABSTRACT\nLaser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) based SS316L parts have a wide range of industrial applications,mainly due to their high strength and good structural integrity.However,there is alack of nano-mechanical studies related to microstructural evolution.The SS3l6L cubes were examined for grain orientation and phase transformation with the help of OMand FESEM with EDX analysis.Cellular and columnar grains were substantiated by FESEM with EDX.Further,the δ ferrite and $\\gamma$ austenite phases occurrence was evident in XRD analysis.The orientation of grains was further examined through EBSD analysis.The microstructural transformation was substantiated by mapping based on modulus. Cellular grains showed a maximum hardness of 6 Gpa,whereas the transverse columnar grains displayed a minimum elastic modulus of 105.8 GPa.Nano-wear and scratch analysis predicted the functions caused by the occurrence of celllar dendritic microstructure,and the topographic wear and scratch tracks confirmed the soft nature of transverse columnar grains by forming more pile-up of materials. Strain Rate Sensitivity (SRS)of the SS316L specimens was analysed based on three diferent strain rates (4.1 $\\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\ s ^ { - 1 }$ $2 . 0 8 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \\ s ^ { - 1 }$ and $3 . 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \\ s ^ { - 1 } )$ . It was concluded that the LPBFed SS316L parts possessed a negative strain rate.In contrast,the simultaneous attainment of maximum Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)and ductility was possible in the quasi-static strain rate.",

    "content": "Afew researchers investigated the microstructural development of LPBFed SS316L parts in detail. Yuji Sato et al. examined the spattering effect while printing SS316L parts.By using a high-resolution camera, they have tracked the spattering caused by the irradiation of the laser and have enhanced the dimensional accuracy,surface roughness and surface finishes by reducing the spattering behaviour on the printed surface by controlling the laser power [6].Few researcher works on electric field intensity to enhance their microstructure.Zhang et al. showed that the electric field intensity had the greatest influence on the atomic diffusion [7].Michal et al. investigated the tension and torsion behaviour of the vertical and horizontal-oriented SS316L printed parts. Theyused finite element analysis for applying Von Mises criterion and Hill criterion to compare the lord-deformation result. They have also compared the conventionally processed Ss316L with the printed SS316L concerning ductility of the parts.They concluded that the machined parts significantly reduced their ductility [8].The phase transformation has the significant contribution in microstructural characteristics which was proven by Xin et al.[9] and Kuang etal.[1O]. Kumaran et al. studied the residual stress during the combined direct energy deposition and powder bed fusion. They have stated that the residual stresses may be compressive or tensile,leading to fatigue cracks.So,they have insisted on analyzing the residual stress of the LPBF SS3l6L substrate before performing the direct energy deposition [11].Similarly,thermal protection performance of the components can also be improved by performing atmospheric plasma spraying technique [l2].Meet et al. associated the possessions of LPBFed SS316L and MS300 maraging steel with the conventional manufacturing process.They have found that MS30O maraging steel has the maximum tensile strength compared with SS316L and the conventional method.",

    "content": "A few research was carried out to analyze the effect of LPBF process parameters.Jae et al.analysed the impact of laser power, scanning speed and energy density on the creep performance of the LPBFed SS316L parts.Similarly,the build direction of the printed parts was also studied based on the creep performance. They have found that the energy density was an essential parameter for enhancing the creep life. Moreover they have confirmed that the vertically oriented parts possessed longer creep life than the horizontally oriented parts [16]. The mechanical characteristics of the fabricated parts was influenced by the phase transformation during the manufacturing process and that was proved by Xu et al. [17] and Wang et al.[18]. Zhiheng et al. found out that,reducing the spot diameter,powder size and laser beam,it was possible to get a better surface without defects and also with dimensional accuracy.To investigate this interaction of attributes， they adopted single-track development in SS316L steel. They also noted some double-crest morphology due to the fine spot size which led to recoil pressure gradient [19]. Pawel et al.emphasized the influence of relative density on the mechanical attributes of different lattice structures made from Ss316L.They have adopted different stud diameters to change the relative density which had a predominant influence on the deformation movements of the printed parts.However, they have concluded that the latice structure with high relative density displayed more performance in stretching， while the lattice structure with lower relative density showed increased performance in bending [2O].

    "content": "They compared the analytical model with the experimentally observed data，conforming that analytical modelling was the effective tool for producing defect-free components [3]. Philipp et al. focused on the process interruption in the static tensile properties of the SS316L and hybrid parts.They have stated that process interruption occurred at the weakened zone of the printed parts.However,it is not possble for the occurrence of failure exactly in the interruption zone all the time,which was proven by testing on the hybrid parts [21]. According to Abbasi etal., the existence of fine grains $( < 2 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ across the printed microstructure was taken into account as proof that dynamic recrystallization occurred during the SLM process [22]. Armin Habibiyan et al. performed a hybrid aditive manufacturing process by adopting open forge (Ampliforge) after completing the additive manufacturing process They have concluded that by adopting this hybrid process, it is possible to obtain a homogenous microstructure without anisotropy of properties [23].\n\nThese surveys confirm that there needs to be more nano-mechanical studies in terms of microstructural evolution during the melt pool formation.Hence,the prime novelty of this study is to examine the formation of cellular and columnar grains on the printed SS316L and their influence over the nano-level properties.Nano-scratch and wear were implemented on five different regions in the printed SS316L parts to examine the effect of microstructural evolution.Similarly, SRS investigation for the SS316L specimens was also performed to investigate the simultaneous attainment of strength and ductility.",

    "content": "Understanding the melting process and examining faults in connection to process parameters was made possible by studying the morphology of the LPBFed SS316L parts.Fig.4 Shows the OM images of the printed SS316L parts from which it is evident that the microstructures are in a micron scale. From these OM images, the overlapping of melt pool boundaries which is recognized by semi-circular shape and tracks perpendicular to the build direction are obvious. However,a few micropores and spattering effects were noted.It is conceivable that the partial melting of the bigger particles in the coarse and raw powders led to binding problems [3O].The SEM analysis in Fig. 5(a-e) shows that, there are two different microstructures,cellular dendrite structure and transverse columnar elongated structure.A similar observation was made by Yusuf etal. [31]. These microstructures were mainly induced by the higher cooling rate of the LPBF process which attributed to the fast solidification process.The cellular dendritic structure created islands of small cellular grains scattered among the columnar grains, which contributed to the hardening effect and lower ductility of the tensile specimens.There were islands of tiny cellular subgrains and transverse columnar subgrains.At the several nucleation sites along the boundary, these islands of small subgrains could be detected [32].This finding is seen in Fig.5(b)and Fig.5(c). It's interesting to note that,as shown in Fig. 5(c), the grains appears normally to the curvature of the fusion lines and that the fusion line does not prevent the expansion of the grains.The columnar grains generally form towards the edge of the melt pool in the direction of the heat flow,which is parallel to the fusion line. Wang et al.[33] examined the relationship between the direction of the columnar grains and the crystal orientation in order to determine the reason of diversity in the direction of the grains'development in the melt pool.",

The Fig. 6 (a-d) displays the Pole Figure and Inverse Pole Figure.Itwas difficult to index the smaller grain structure that resulted from the transverse columnar structure's fused area.This intricate grain structure distribution was due to the LPBF technique which possessed a faster cooling rate [34].These fine grain structures along with the fused regions had an essential role in the strengthening mechanism and also aided in reducing the ductility of the printed SS316L [35].The orientation of grains was analyzed based on the IPFs.The analysis verified that the transverse columnar grain structures were oriented in the direction of $< 1 0 1 >$ ， indicating that the crystal cubes of the surface-textured normal are mostly orientated in that direction.The formation mechanism of grain structures is often described in terms of compositional variations and the supercooling theory [36]. The cellular grain structure was caused by an increased thermal gradient and decreased growth velocity. Similarly, the columnar structure was caused by the decreased thermal gradient and increased growth velocity.As previously stated,LPBFed materials were more severely strained at faster heating and cooling processes [37]. As a result, LPBFed materials that experience faster heating and cooling processes are supposed to cause more dislocation networks than conventionally manufactured metals with relatively slower heating and cooling processes.\n\n![](images/1350fc939c009d900e9fef9f3e00daa0b12cb8175334c0d11ea8a59075316254.jpg)  \nFig6.Es inverse pole figures.",

However, there is no experimental and theoretical supporting evidence justifying the grain formation mechanism prediction based on the thermal gradient and growth velocity. Sub-grain microstructure development by the LPBF process was characterized by a high density of dislocation networks and sometimes segregation of heavier elements.

Moreover, the microstructural evolution during the manufacturing process has a key role in influencing the mechanical properties and that was proven by Chen et al.[43] and Deng et al.[44].The pile-up of debris along the edges of the wear tracks also confirmed their resistance to plastic deformation [45].Based on the observation of the pile-up of materials around the edges,wear tracks1 and 3 possessed the maximum pile-up of around $1 1 5 . 9 5 \\ : \\mathrm { n m }$ .This observation confirmed the maximum removal of materials due to the presence of transverse columnar grains in that region [46].But,in the wear tracks 2,4 and 5,there was no noteworthy pile-up of materials around $4 5 . 5 9 \\mathrm { n m }$ .This characteristic represented the occurrence of cellular grain structure,which reduced the material removal rate.This observation confirmed that the formation of cellular grain structure during the melt pool formation had a predominant resistance towards the wear and scratch effects.However, the noted pile-up of materials around the edges in the wear analysis was higher compared with the scratch analysis,since the load adopted during the testing was higher.Also the number of the repetitive cycles was more.Moreover,the scratch test was analysed only to understand the surface morphology.",

The lateral load fluctuated in the early plowing operation,but afterward,as shown in Fig.1O (al-el),it exhibited a smooth and consistent removal of materials.These fluctuations were due to the different grain boundary orientations.Local fractures,cracks or bends in the nano-indenter tips may happen due to such characteristics.\n\n![](images/6d1c966154cbc4e719328ed01942986d45b7a7bb96077c8af31733e6cdcad2f0.jpg)  \nig",

Therefore, by adopting a reduced strain rate,this quasi-static situation induced the elastic nature.Furthermore,the dislocation motions were limited by the grains’cellular structure.Similarly,these cellular structured grains acted as the hindrance for the cracks propagation by arresting the interruptions. Subsequently,the higher SR led to the early failure in which the crack propagation reached the various stress-concentrated regions especially in the fusion lines [47]. It was clear that localization and necking followed softening.",

    "content": "However,as the strain rate increased, the behaviour changed from ductile to brittle,which in turn caused the elongation to drop.This resulted from the faster dislocation speed. During the higher strain rates,the stress concentration was higher in the defect region such as the balling effect and pores formation.So the propagation of cracks follows the defects formation which appears to be a brittle zone.The similar crack propagation along the stress field was experience by Fu et al.[48].The formation of dimples was visible when the strain rate was slow and constant,as seen in Fig.l2(a), because localization and necking both of which were brought on by the $4 . 1 \\times 1 0 { - } 5 \\ { s } ^ { - 1 }$ slow and steady strain rate caused the progressive dislocation movement. However,defect formation also plays a significant role in the fracture mechanics.Because the defect region acts as the stress-concentrated region in which the defect region initiates the crack propagation [49].",

    "content": "The stress-concentrated area along the interface was where the fracture first appeared. Unmelted particles in the middle of consecutive were noted as shown in Fig.12 (b).These defect region might have operated as areas of concentrated stress,causing cracks,especially under high strain rate conditions.When the strain rate was multiplied by 5, cracks started to spread quickly. The emergence of cleavage facets denotes the brittle fracture and the evidence for the rapid propagation of cracks [5O].The presence of cellular grains contributed to the printed SS316L components'enhanced tensile strength at a lower strain rate by acting as a barrier to the propagation of fractures.However,when the strain rate increased,the stress concentration in the cellular grains increased and the cohesive force supplied by the columnar and cellular grains decreased relative to the applied tensile force.Similar to the originalcrack， thesubordinatecracksalsobegan atthe stress-concentrated region and traveled towards the initial crack that starts at the microstructural flaws.As a result, cracks spread quickly and clues to brittle fracture [Fig.12 (c)]. The Orowan process was reflected in this crack propagation phenomenon.It was also discovered that transgranular dimple rupture was triggered by keyholes {{{Fig.13}}}.\n\n![](images/3809561a8712bac7dd0c2c5f46f9b34d287f7ee07224f5d12085b017348c297b.jpg)  \nFig.11.Stress-strain curve for LPBFed SS316L tensile specimens under various strain rates: $\\operatorname { E 1 } { : 4 . 1 } \\times 1 0 { - 5 } \\ : s ^ { - 1 }$ ， $\\mathtt { E 2 } { \\cdot } 2 . 0 8 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \\ s { \\cdot } 1$ $\\mathrm { E } 3 { : } 3 . 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \\ : s ^ { - 1 }$",

The microstructural investigation revealed two types of grain orientations namely,the cellular dendrite structure and the transverse columnar elongated structure. Another interesting observation was that the grains looked orientated normally to the fusion lines' curvature and that the fusion line did not inhibit the growth of the grains.   \n· The TEM analysis witnessed the occurrence of $\\gamma$ austenite and EBSD analysis revealed the cellular and columnar grains and also confirmed the transverse columnar grain structures were oriented towards the $< 1 0 1 >$ direction.Moreover, due to the rapid cooling rate of the LPBF technique,there was no sufficient time to attain a homogenous microstructure.   \n·The nano-hardness results reveal that the presence of a red-coloured region in the hardness and reduced modulus mapping represents the cellular grain structure which possesses a maximum hardness value of 6 GPa and a maximum reduced modulus of 22o GPa. Similarly, the yellow-coloured region shows the transverse columnar grain structure reflecting the minimum hardness and reduced modulus of $1 . 4 \\ : \\mathrm { G P a }$ and $1 0 5 . 8 \\mathrm { G P a }$   \n·Nanowear track 1 and 3 possessed a maximum pile-up of around $1 1 5 . 9 5 \\mathrm { n m }$ ，This observation confirmed the maximum removal of materials,due to the presence of transverse columnar grains in that region.

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising method in near-netshape fabrication of components made of hard-to-machine metals (e. g.,titanium alloys and nickel-based super alloys) with complex geometries [1]. Selective laser melting (SLM),electron beam melting (EBM), wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) and direct energy deposition (DED) are the typical methods in additive manufacturing of metallic products [2].However,extensive post-processing is often required owing to the inaccurate geometric dimension and poor surface quality of the additively manufactured components [3]. For example, the surface roughness Ra of the parts fabricated by DED can be up to $6 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ due to the melting/reconsolidating of powders [4]; whereas in SLM,the powder spatter and balling effect during the melting/reconsolidating process may lead to defects such as pores and cracks,which eventually undermine the surface integrity of the products [5]. The severe spatter and balling on the solidified layer can also cause uneven distribution of powders on the powder bed or even the scraping-off of the powder, resulting in the termination of the printing process. Consequently,the coarse surfaces of the additively manufactured parts need to be machined during the post-processing process.This step is crucial and indispensable in ensuring the quality of the final products.",

This synthetization harnesses the strengths of both techniques,offering heightened flexibility,enhanced machining efficiency,and improved dimensional accuracy [6].The ASM can be divided into two categories [7]: sequential additive-subtractive manufacturing (SASM) and hybrid additivesubtractive manufacturing (HASM). In SASM, components are initially produced using additive manufacturing to achieve near-net-shape, followed by finish cutting processes such as turning and milling to meet surface roughness and dimensional requirements.On the other hand,in the HAsM process,machining operations are alternatively conducted and are integrated in the additive manufacturing process.

    "content": "The current studies on ASM are mainly focused on the processing window of additive manufacturing and its effects on the machinability of the printed workpieces such as cuttng force, temperature,surface roughness and tool wear [8] in comparison with wrought, forged or cast materials. Salvi et al.[9] compared the machinability of IN625 fabricated by AM and wrought,and found that wrought IN625 consumed more power than AMed IN625 due to the higher tool wear rate. The higher thermal conductivity of AMed IN625 resulted in a $1 9 1 . 5 5 \\ \\%$ increase in tool life.In the studies of Kallel et al.[1O,11],Ti6Al4V fabricated by direct metal deposition (DMD) was finished by high speed milling. Compared with its wrought counterparts,the DMDed material resulted in a $1 0 { - } 4 0 ~ \\%$ increase in cutting forces and higher roughness because of the more significant ploughing and rubbing effects.In the study of Val et al. [12], it was found that the surface roughness of Invar 36 fabricated by WAAM after milling was lower, compared with that of the wrought material.However, the milling forces were higher in the machining of the WAAMed workpiece due to the higher hardness. Montevecchi et al.[13] compared cutting forces in the milling of AISIH13 materials fabricated by laser engineered net shaping (LENS), WAAM and the as-received workpiece.The hardness of WAAM and LENS are 55 HRC and 59 HRC,which were significantly higher than that of the wrought parts (19 HRC).Therefore,the cutting forces and cutting coefficients show a general increase when machining the AMed workpieces,indicating the poor machinability of AM parts. Ding et al. [14] found that the angle and width of tearing streaks of chips in milling DEDed 316L was wider because the improved mechanical properties limited the plastic deformation of the workpiece material.Bai et al.[15] conducted a study on the machinability of DEDed ASTM A131 stainless steel.",

    "content": " It was found the boundaries of the melt pools hinders the plastic deformation of the workpiece materials,leading to higher cutting force. Bonaiti et al.[16] found that as the hardness of DEDed Ti6Al4V increases, the milling force gradually increases,and the DEDed workpieces are more prone to generate serrated chips,compared with conventional forged materials.Oyelola et al.[17] utilized heat treatments to homogenize the microstructure of DEDed Ti6Al4V，enhancing the machinability.The results presented the $4 0 \\%$ reduction in cutting forces in the beta condition and a $2 4 ~ \\%$ reduction in the alpha condition at a low machining speed of $5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m / m i n }$ ，whereas the compressive stress on the machined surface exhibited a $2 2 ~ \\%$ increase. Guo et al. [18] investigated the cutting of AMed 316L and found that the cuting responses were influenced by cutting directions.The anisotropy of the dendritic microstructure in the printing direction caused higher hardness than that in the scanning direction, therefore,the cutting forces were larger when cutting along the printing direction.Alonso et al.[19] investigated the machinability of Inconel 718 made of WAAM. They found that higher cutting speeds $( \\ge 6 0 \\ \\mathrm { m / m i n } )$ were preferred,contributing to better surface roughness and lower torque of the main spindle.Additionally,milling along the torch's travel direction demonstrated better dimensional tolerance values and lower cutting torques compared to machining in the building direction.Lizzul et al.[2O] investigated the influence of $\\alpha$ -grain boundaries (αGB) on the development of tool wear in micro-milling AMed Ti6Al4V.",

    "content": "Although the machinability of alloys fabricated by different AM methods has been comprehensively investigated from different aspects, most of the findings were made based on SASM.The role of mechanical cutting in HASM and the influence induced by conventional cutting on the quality of parts after the completion of the entire HASM process are seldomly explored.The quality of the machined surface and the deformation affected region beneath the machined surface can influence the subsequent AM process.Specifically,the roughness of the machined surface due to the ploughing effect or the surface defects such as dimples and scratches caused by the plucking of insufficiently-melted materials could impact the bedding of the powder,and eventually affect the quality of the printed parts.In the cutting process,the deformationaffected region,which comprises hardening and softening regions,are formed by the high temperature and workpiece distortion.Near the machined surface,the hardness is significantly higher than that of the bulk workpiece.This high hardness is attributed to the nanoscale grain refinement which is the result of severe plastic deformation at low cutting speeds or phase transformation at high cutting speeds [23]. Underneath the hardening region lies the softening area,where the impact of thermal softening outweighs work hardening.In this area, the elongation of the grains could be found,and the hardness in this area was lower than that of the bulk material [24].",

[26] analyzed the deformation regions formed in drilling DMLSed Ti6Al4V.Similar to the results of Rotella et al.,it was found that the thickness of the metamorphic layer was larger at higher spindle speeds because the ploughing-pulling effect of the cuting tool was significant at higher cuting speeds,and secondary shear plastic deformation was induced beneath the machined surface [27].Studies of influences of the deformation-affected region on the following AM processes are scarce.In the study of Chen etal. [28],finish milling was applied during the gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW)of TC4, and it was found that the hardness increased at the regions used to be the hardening zones.This phenomenon was explained by the formation of smaller $\\beta$ grains and the increased proportion of $\\leq 1 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\alpha$ grains in the following AM process,and this grain refinement also improved the ultimate strength of the HASMed material. Similar mechanism was revealed in the study of Ren et al.[29], which was about manufacturing Inconel 738 by hybrid SLM and high-speed milling.The experimental results show that the mix of slender and fine grains was found at the AM/ SM interface,which relieved the residual stress induced by the highspeed milling.Lee et al.[3O] investigated the influence of part deformation on residual stress in HASMed SS316L by using finite element method.",

    "content": "Thay discovered that the part exhibited a pattern of tensilecompression alternation,which was attributed to the combination of deposit shrinkage,solid constraint,and stress balancing due to the subtractive manufacturing.However,work hardening and phase transformation were neglected in the modelling process.He et al.[31] manufactured 316L stainless steel thin-wall through HASM,and found that there was a significant tensile stress at the junction of AM and SM. The stress first decreased and then increased with the ongoing of the HASM.In addition， the compressive stress generated by milling balanced the initial residual tensile stress of the AM. Gong et al. [32] discovered that the high density and fine grains of the HASMed material were the primary factors contributing to the increases in hardness, tensile strength,and ductility.\n\nFrom above studies,it can be summarized that the coupled influence of additive manufacturing and subtractive manufacturing on the cuting responses and overall mechanical properties is still limited,and the fundamental mechanism on the evolution of the microstructures HASMed materials needs to be analyzed in-deep to further expand the knowledge on HASM.In this study,316L stainless steel was manufactured by a hybrid approach which combines a two-stage micro selective laser melting $\\mathbf { ( \\mu S L M ) }$ and a finish milling process.In addition to the conventional machining responses which include phases,surface morphology and cutting forces,the effects of work hardening on the evolution of microstructure,hardness,and mechanical properties at the re-AMed regions were investigated.

Cutting forces were measured via a three-axis piezoelectric dynamometer (YDl5-II)，and the morphology and roughness of the top surface before/after milling were characterized by the laser confocal microscope (KEYENCE-VHX-7OoO).Ra,which was the average of five-time measurements at randomly-selected positions,was used to quantify the surface roughness for every sample.After the milling process,the parts were additively manufactured into the designed dimensions with the same parameters listed in Table 1,and then machined into the dog-bone shape of standard tensile test specimens by wire EDM (WEDM) for tension testing. These specimens were tested in tension along the printing direction and perpendicular to the printing direction (Fig.4),respectively,to investigate the influences of the deformation-affected region on the mechanical properties of the materials in different directions.\n\n![](images/0ab02e8acef1a06aa4430c15d579332d6e62745a442cbc56931caf04d436bdfc.jpg)  \nFig.1.Schemeof theadditive-subtractive-additive manufacturingof316.

Conventional machining responses after different machining stages\n\nFig.5 shows the morphology of the top surface after the first-stage $\\mu \\mathrm { S L M }$ process and the subsequent milling process.It is obvious that the surface after $\\mu { \\bf S L M }$ was uneven due to unmelted powders and the splatter of spheroidization.Spheroidization is the solidification of metal powder into a spherical shape under the action of surface tension during melting,or the splashing of liquid metal into unmelted powder,and the splatter of spheroidization can be caused by the lateral shielding gas flow,melt pool fluctuations,and the vapor recoil pressure.The blow of the internal vapor is the main driving force for the occurrence of splatter during the SLM processes. Under the irradiation of the high-energy laser, the 316L metal powder uniformly reaches the melting point of temperature $\\mathrm { T } _ { \\mathrm { m } } ,$ and forms the melt pools.The excessive energy inevitably causes the powder to rapidly reach the boiling point $\\mathrm { T _ { b } }$ and generates 316L metal vapor or plasma plume [34].As shown in Figs. 5(a) to (c), the surface splatter significantly decreases with the increase of scanning speed.This is because,at scanning speeds of $8 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s$ and $9 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s ,$ the speed of the moving melt pool could exceed the speed of the splatter, thus trapping the droplets within the melt pool [35].However, the energy absorption at a higher scanning speed was insuficient, which aggravates the unmelted powders on the machined surface,as can be seen in Figs. 5(b) and (c).",

Conversely,when the scanning speed is high,the laser beam impacts each position for a shorter duration,and if the heat inside the melted pool is not sufficient to melt the powder,voids could be formed due to the gaps between the raw particles and the reconsolidated materials.Moreover,the laser shock at higher scanning speed could repel the insufficiently melted powders,causing voids on the printed surface [36].",

However, the differences among the cutting forces are not pronounced, indicating the similar yield and ultimate strength of the three materials. Figs.7(d) to (g) are the frequency-domain spectrums of the X,Y and Z cutting forces processed by Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT).Specifically, larger amplitudes were found at $7 5 \\mathrm { H z } ,$ which is the frequency of the spindle,and $2 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ ，which is the frequency of cutting,and their high-order harmonics.The cutting/spindle frequencies of Sample B are larger because of the higher cutting force in the time-domain signals.

Yakout et al.

Crystal lattice distortions change the lattice constants of the crystal and the scattering behavior of the X-ray,causing the shift of the peak.When the grain size was smaller than the wavelength of the incident X-rays, the crystal size effect occurs,and the scattering behavior of X-rays is limited,causing an overall shift of the phase peaks towards higher angles [41].The work hardening on the milled surface not only affects the phase composition of the material, but also influences the microstructure and mechanical properties.",

Columnar grains are formed at higher $\\scriptstyle { \\mathrm { G } } / { \\mathrm { R } }$ ratio,and grow in the direction of the maximum heat flow (center of the melt pool),as shown in Fig.10.The growth of the columnar grains spans through multiple layers,as shown in Figs.1O(a)-(c).

The asymmetric indenting mark also reflects the variation of the hardness from the hardening region to the softening region (Fig.15(b)).In the hardening region, the dimension of the indentation was smaller than the bulk material (Fig.15(a)),and the size of the indentation became larger in the softening region.The nanocrystallization caused by the high-strain rate shear deformation is the major mechanism for the increase in hardness on the machined surface [29].In Fig.11,the pool boundaries are discernible,whereas the growth of the fine columnar grains is not obvious;a high density of nanoscale pores,which is the microscopic defects caused by large-strain plastic deformation,can be found within the hardening regions.The softening region is evident with the range of approx. $3 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,the hardness of which is about $1 2 \\mathrm { H V }$ lower than that of the bulk workpiece.In this region, the influence of thermal softening overweighs the effect of work hardening[23],and the slightly lower hardness of the Sample A indicates that the thermal effect in the mechanical cutting was more obvious.",

Generally, the density of the AMed materials is smaller than that of the wrought counterparts because of the existence of the pores and voids caused by the insufficient melting of the powder or rapid solidification of the melt pool [23].In comparison, the local relative density of the material in the deformation region is larger because the severe distortion of the workpiece due to work hardening can eliminate the micropores produced in AM.After the second-stage $\\mu { \\mathrm { S L M } }$ ,the dimension of the melt pools within the connection region (used to be the deformation region) significantly (Fig.13) reduced,which reduced the cooling rate and eventually stimulated the refine of the cellular grains.\n\n![](images/5d3eb0cd5152c0870f8db14822676625ab5a66f0ad5ad3a0515c808bf51ad5c4.jpg)  \nFig.10.

The columnar crystal can grow through the regions where used to be the deformation affected regions,and even across multiple melt pools;a significant number of nanoscale cellular grains and a small amount of fine columnar grains are found in the additive-subtractive connected area.Due to the energy distribution of the Gaussian laser beam,the higher migration rate of grain boundaries stimulates the formation of cellular grains in the high-temperature region,whereas the formation of columnar grains is favorable at the lower migration rate of the grain boundaries [47]. Because the thermal conductivity of metals with high hardness is higher than that of materials with low-hardness [48],the temperature rise in the hardening regions was larger than that in the bulk workpiece,facilitating the formation of more nanoscale cellular grains in this region,as shown in Figs. $\\mathbf { 1 2 ( a _ { 1 } ) }$ and $\\left( \\mathbf { c } _ { 1 } \\right)$ .In addition,it can be observed that fine grains in cellular structure are mainly distributed at the boundaries of the melt pool,which indicates the lower $\\scriptstyle { \\mathrm { G } } / { \\mathrm { R } }$ ratio and the higher $\\mathbf { G } \\times \\mathbf { R }$ value in this region.\n\n![](images/a7d9c6f703d1f204e3c5c8552c98d83a7ad9837114a7e25ef4a8a807ffe198f8.jpg)  \nFig.11.The microstructure of SMed area.

    "content": "However,the formation of the nano-sized cellular structure did not lead to the increase in hardness,which is different from the mechanism of grain refinement in work hardening or the refined grains strengthening.It was reported in the study of Fu etal.[49] that the hardness of the micron laser PBFed materials was smaller due to the existence of the small-sized cellular structure.This could be ascribed to the formation of the new heat-afected zone (HAZ） caused by the following $\\mu \\mathrm { S L M }$ process,which affected the distribution of the hardness.As shown in Fig.15(c),the indentation length in the region with larger cellular structures is $1 8 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ，whereas the the indentation length in the region with smaller cellular structures is $2 1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } .$ ,and it explained the reduction in this region.The reductions of hardness in the connecting regions of the three scanning speeds are different.At the scanning speed of 700 $\\mathrm { m m } / s$ ,the decrease in hardness of the HAZ was $5 0 \\mathrm { H V }$ ,and the range of the HAZ was $8 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,both of which were larger than those of the samples at $8 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s$ and $9 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s$ .On one hand,more energy was accumulated in the melt pool at lower scanning speed,and stimulates the formation of the larger heat-affected zone,which is also the reason of the larger size of the melt pool. On the other hand,the hardening regions with higher thermal conductivity also affect the heat-affected zone of the second-stage $\\mu { \\bf S } \\mathrm { L M }$ ，resulting in uneven cooling rates. Uneven cooling rates can lead to changes in grain size,thereby reducing the hardness of the joint area.",

    "content": "Fig.16 shows the stress-strain curves of samples fabricated by $\\mu { \\mathrm { S L M } }$ and HASM.The printing direction has a significant effect on the tensile properties of the workpiece.When the tension is parallel to the scanning direction，the three workpieces exhibit higher elongation rates compared to samples under tension perpendicular to the scanning direction.This difference is attributed to the anisotropy of the mechanical properties of the AMed metals in different directions.In the scanning direction,the intergranular bonding within the layers is the main resistance,which is the strongest,followed by the bonding between adjacent scan tracks,and the interlayer bonding [1O]. Under the tension in the vertical direction,dislocations can slide along the entire length of the grain boundary and slip plane,resulting in uniform plastic deformation.When the tension is exerted in the printing direction,plastic deformation tends to occur along the grain boundary,causing stress concentration along columnar grain boundaries [37].Columnar grains provide more grain boundaries as dislocation barriers,thereby increasing the plastic strength under tensile loading in the horizontal direction.In contrast,the difference in the tensile strengths of the three samples is insignificant, which could be ascribed to the internal defects. When tension is exerted in the printing direction, defects such as pores and cracks deteriorate the interlayer bonding，affecting the tensile strength.Similarly,under the tension in the scanning direction,cracks and pores within the single layer can lead to slightly decrease in tensile strength.Also, from the stress-strain curves,it can be found that the application of finish milling did not change the anisotropic tensile strength of the samples significantly.",

(b) Changes in the melt pool depth.\n\nGrain refinement,especially in the form of nanoscale cellular substructures,contributes to the excellent mechanical properties by providing high strength while maintaining good ductility [34]．As shown in Fig.12, the uniform distribution of ultrafine cellular subgrains could be found at the melt pool boundary within the connection region of the HASMed materials.According to Chen et al.[45],the plastic deformation within the melt pool was difficult to occur compared with that of at the boundary,and the failure of the materials was prone to occur along the boundary of the melt pool due to the fewer dislocations, leading to the decrease of mechanical properties of SLMed 316L. Also, Wanni et al.[5O] proposed that the refinement of dynamic slip bands caused by cellular subgrain was the main mechanism for improving the strength and ductility of DEDed SS 316L,because cellular subgrain have a hindering effect on the evolution of slip bands.In this study,the nanoscale cellular subgrains in connection regions of the HASMed samples increase the local dislocation density，contributing to the improvement of elongation rates.Compared with the HD samples, the difference on the strain among the VD samples are obvious,due to the larger connection area of the VD samples.\n\n![](images/f35c0fdec35988febd76d72cebd44dd40ba15920fd3685f30901819d9a3b757c.jpg)  \nFig4edd of hardness in the additive-subtractive junction area.",

    "content": "The metal additive manufacturing (AM) industry has evolved significantly due to industrial and societal challenges.Selective laser melting (SLM) stands out among these technologies,although its complexity has posed challenges to the development of new materials due to its complexity.Compared to traditional methods,which typically entail lengthy cycles and high expenses, SLM technology can produce intricate parts more efficiently and at a lower cost than traditional methods [1,2].The SLM process combines pulsed lasers and powder bed fusion to create complex 3D objects from metallic powders.Due to this technology,it has been possible to produce complex parts with complex geometries,which has resulted in better performance of the parts [3,4].\n\nSLM has many applications that extend beyond the aerospace and automotive sectors [5].Various approaches have recently been introduced to shape AM components,but SLM has emerged as the most prevalent method [6,7].An array of components is produced using this process, including components made out of steel, titanium, aluminum, and nickel.As a result of its substantial utility within the biomedical, aerospace,energy，and automotive industries,stainless steel 316L (SS316L) has attracted extensive attention within this context [8-10].\n\nWith less than $0 . 0 3 ~ \\%$ carbon content, SS316L is highly compatible with the SLM process because of its low carbon content[11-13].While SLM can offer many advantages,it can also cause a wide range of undesirable defects,adversely affecting various properties,including mechanical properties,geometric accuracy,and surface finish on the components produced.\n\nThe behavior of SS316L additive manufacturing has been the subject of numerous studies.The study by G.Sander etal.[14] investigated the corrosion properties of 316L stainless steel manufactured through selective laser melting.They observed a direct influence of build orientation on the microstructure of the produced metals and alloys.",

    "content": "The study conducted by Itziar Tolosa et al.[16] delved into the mechanical characteristics of SS316L steel post-processing via SLM while exploring variations arising from diferent manufacturing approaches,including alterations in building orientations.Ultimately, these attributes were compared against the established specifications for this steel in its \"wrought\" form.Notably,the yield strengths of this alloy were found to be more significant following the SLM process compared to its rolled state.Furthermore,it was observed that SLM specimens exhibited a hardness akin to what is seen in wrought products of this alloy.Charpy test results suggested that these specimens had a marginally lower value than wrought products’ specifications.\n\nThe investigations led by Tomasz Kurzynowski et al.[17] have revealed that laser power and scanning methods significantly influence the microstructures and textures of materials.Their findings indicate that laser energy density and scanning strategy play a crucial role in shaping the cellular substructure of austenite,determining the presence of ferrite,and influencing the type and intensity of texture.This culminated in a twofold increase in yield strength,enhanced ultimate tensile strength,and a 1.4-fold reduction in elongation at fracture compared to hot-rolled SS316L sheets.\n\nIn a study conducted by Jin Myoung Jeon et al. [18],the impact of microstructure and internal defects on the mechanical behavior of austenitic stainless steel 316L produced through selective laser melting was examined. The research revealed that the presence of pores predominantly influenced the anisotropy observed in tensile tests.Due to localized stress concentrations around these pores,it led to localized yielding and subsequent crack propagation. This,in turn,resulted in significant disparities in strength and ductility.",

    "content": "In recent years, numerous studies have investigated printing defects, such as porosity,keyhole formation,balling,and melt pool stability [19-24]. In order to minimize defects in SLM,it is crucial to understand a range of processing parameters,such as layer thickness,scanning strategy,pattern filling distance,spot size,focus,and laser power,that are crucial to the process [25].\n\nPore formation,for instance,is attributed to improper selection of laser power and scan speed [26]. Larimian et al.[27] demonstrated that higher laser power and slower scanning speeds significantly enhance the mechanical properties of SLM-processed samples.Laser power exerts a more significant influence on SLM processes than scanning speed.Hsu et al.[28] noted that low laser power prevents 316L powder from melting and bonding,while high power leads to keyhole formation.\n\nShort hatch spaces resulted in the highest density and hardness for 316L.Conversely,long hatch spaces yielded the lowest relative density for the samples.Achieving effective powder layer fusion necessitated higher energy density as hatch space increased.Ronneberg et al.[23] observed a positive and directionally dependent correlation between porosity and ductility.Horizontally constructed samples exhibited higher porosity levels but more excellent ductility,a phenomenon explained by the shape and orientation of pores.Most porosity stemmed fromsignificant fusion defects and pores with a high aspect ratio clustered along layer boundaries.Pore accumulation was evident on the fracture surfaces of both horizontal and vertical samples.\n\nTable 2 Specifications of the NOURA M10OP SLM machine.

The optical micrographs indicate complete melting of the powder,and the melt pools in vertical planes exhibit a characteristic 'fish scale’morphology (Fig. 6(a)).Fig.6(b) displays the melting traces and melt pools generated by the scanning laser beam.In sample C-6, the melt pool width measures approximately $1 3 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } .$ ,while the height is about $6 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ ,depending on the direction of the laser beam.The melt pool size may vary based on laser spot size and input energy density [46].\n\nWith each repetition，previously heated melt pools can undergo partial re-melting,resulting in well-aligned melt pools spaced regularly.

The molten powder and previously solidified layer must be coherent in terms of chemistry and crystallography in order to allow these grains to persist.As long as voids,porosity,or balling effects did not introduce chemical or crystallographic composition variations, the nucleation of new grains was unimpeded.Due to these congruities, the grains grew in alignment with the crystal orientation of the preceding layer [44,52].Molten material solidifying in its preferred orientation at high volumetric energy density (VED) has an extended solidification period due to the substantial thermal gradient. Consequently, increasing VED leads to an enlargement in columnar grain size [35].It is confirmed in the study by Larimian etal.[53] that grain size increases with increasing energy density.They also provided an explanation for this phenomenon,highlighting that higher energy density leads to larger melt pools. These larger melt pools consequently lead to a coarsermicrostructure.",

Cracks occur when micro-voids at defect sites,such as secondphase inclusions,coalesce during tensile tests.Due to the prevalent presence of cellular networks,only nano-voids can form in SLM SS316L. Consequently, fractures tend to transpire more ductility at nano-void necks than micro-void necks,forming nano-sized dimples on the fracture surfaces [70,71].\n\nIn summary,tensile fractures manifest in two distinct ways: The first is the junctions of layers;a fragile crack initiates and intensifies under tension.As stress concentrations trigger the crack's progression，it adopts a scallop pattern as it extends into the micro crack within,and the second is the fact that the crack continues until it encounters the unmelted metal powder,resulting in a smooth outer surface.Upon reachinga defect-free region,fluctuations in stress intensify,leading to plastic necking and the subsequent formation of a dimple.The propagation of cracks is contingent on various factors,including crack size and type,whether it encounters unmelted powder or defect-free areas,and more.The progression of cracks manifests a diverse array of tearing patterns,such as scallops,dimples,and smooth surfaces [32,68,72,73].",

In contrast, the $1 2 5 \\mathrm { J / m m ^ { 3 } }$ energy density produced large, deep melt pools without unmelted powders or cracks. Keyhole pores were formed as energy density increased.   \n4 The ANOVA results indicate that scanning speed is the most significant for affecting density,followed by layer thickness and power.   \n5 The porosity and microstructure of the as-built part have a major impact on its hardness.Scan speed is the most critical parameter affecting hardness,followed by power，while layer thickness is comparativelylessimportant.   \n6 The yield and tensile strength of the parts range from $6 2 4 \\pm 8$ MPa to $6 4 9 \\pm 4$ MPa.The grain size and the defects directly affect these\n\nvalues. Strength values drop as scanning speed increases and energy density decreases because of a decrease in material density.",

    "content": "The objective ofthis study is to comprehend how changes in laser speed afect the behaviour and features of neck formation in Ss316L during powder bed fusion.This study examines the impact of various laser speeds on the neck formation in the commonly used SS316L. Uniweld Laser 30oo was used for laser joining.A constant laser power of $_ { 1 5 \\mathrm { W } }$ and laser scan speed of $2 5 { - } 1 5 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ were implemented,and powder joining within a single track was observed.Results show that neck size decreases with increasing laser scanning speed and no particle joining occurs at $1 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s$ scan speed,as it is considered too fast for sufficient heat absorption and melting.As laser speed decreases to $1 2 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s$ ,neck starts to form because the particles absorb more heat,which facilitates melting and bonding. Surface diffusion occurs early at this stage because it requires only a small amount of energy to break atomic bonds on the surfaces of particles compared to those in the internal part.This process involves atoms moving along the surfaces of the particles,facilitating the initial stages of sintering by reducing surface energy and causing neck formation between particles.At $1 2 5 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ ,the particle shape remains spherical, and the average neck size is $4 9 \\ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ .At $1 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ ,the powder average neck size is $6 2 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ .Moreover,the powder completely merges at $5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s$ and $2 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s$ .The neck formed between particles considerably improves the product's mechanical strength by strengthening bonds between particles.Material density increases with neck quality,and stable neck growth can reduce the porosity of the finalparts.Ensuring thermal stability inthe laser powder bed fusion alows consistent heat to particles,ensuring even temperature in materials and ultimately facilitating stable neck growth.",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is a three-dimensional (3D) printing process that produces a 3D object by adding material layer by layer through a computer-controlled process [1].3D printing has been widely used because it can produce complex geometries with low amount of material waste [2],thus drawing considerable interest from medical, aerospace,automotive,and marine industries [3,4].Various types of 3D printing techniques have been developed for diferent types of materials, offering unique advantages and specific applications.These techniques include fused deposition modelling (FDM) for plastics,selective laser sintering for metals and polymers,and stereolithography for resins [5]. One of the techniques used in metallic powder is laser powder bed fusion (LPBF)which usies a high-powered laser to selectively melt and fuse layers of metallic powder to create complex,high-precision parts [6,7]. Laser technology in manufacturing has traditionally been utilized in applications such as cutting [8],drilling [9,1O],welding [11],and joining.Recently,attention has shifted towards its use in additive manufacturing [l2]，particularly in powder joining processes.This advancement necessitates the optimization of parameters to ensure precise melting of particles layer by layer,enabling the creation of complex and high-quality components [13].In LBPF,a high-power laser was used to melt metal powder particles to form 3D parts [14-16]. The melted powder forms a liquid bridge known as necking bridges,which connect the particles [17,18].The neck is typically non-spherical with a circular cros-section,and its profile is comparable to a one-sheet hyperboloid known as kink [19].",

    "content": "Extensive studies on LPBF have focused on laser parameters,such as laser power and scanning speed [2O,21].However,neck formation in LPBF is considerably influenced by the critical factor of powder parameters,such as particle shape,particle size and particle size distribution,which also affects neck growth ratio.Hence,neck formation between particles is one of the crucial phenomena that can be observed in AM,since the quality of particle neck affects the quality of final products.\n\nParticle neck forms through sintering mechanisms,including surface diffusion (SD),volume diffusion (VD） and grain boundary diffusion (GBD)[22].The initial stages of neck formation involve SD mechanism phases,in which grain boundaries diffuse with neighbouring particles through a process known as necking.In this process,diffusion occurs only on the outer surface,where a small amount of heat energy is required to rearrange atoms on the surfaces of particles.Due to rearrangement of grain boundary atoms,porosity arises between particles. When substantial energy is absorbed by the particles,VD occurs,in which the neck size increases,internal particles diffuse and the pore size decreases [23]. Pores decrease in size either because solid particles enter the pores during the rearrangement of atoms to the surfaces of pores between particles [24] or gas is released from pores [25].As the sintering time increases,GBD occurs,in which rapid neck size growth occurs at grain boundaries.Such growth is aided by irregular particle shapes,which enhances grain boundary growth [26].However,determining the diffusion type in VD and GBD mechanisms is difficult because diffusion occurs in the internal parts of atoms.At the initial stage of SD, the formation of kinks between the particles can be clearly observed.For proper sintering mechanisms,the stages begin with SD,followed by VD and GBD.However,controlling this process is challenging because GBD occurs ata relatively faster rate than VD.",

    "content": "Despite the importance of interparticle necking in AM, experimental studies on the process is lacking,and studies have focused on simulation research in recent years [24,27-31].A study developed a molecular dynamics (MD) model to explore the sintering mechanism of AlSi10Mg with varying particles sizes [31]; the diffusion of unequally sized particles is faster than that of equally sized particles; this finding highlights the importance of particle size distribution in the optimization of sintering processes for materials,such as AlSiloMg.Li etal.[3O] conducted MD simulations to study the sintering behaviour of silver nanoparticles and nanoflakes of the same size.Meanwhile,Dai et al.[29] simulated neck growth through SD mechanisms in metal fibres by using the lattice Boltzmann method.Both studies found that the key mechanism for necking is SD,elucidating how atoms move across the surfaces of particles,aggregate in neck areas and facilitating bond formation and neck growth.Another study determined that the displacement per atom/mm increases with sintering temperature in the internal and surface atoms of the particles [28]. These simulations show how particles bond during sintering,emphasising the importance of factors,such as particle size and temperature.",

One study setup a dedicated experiment for sintering two isolated titanium particles with three different pulsed laser rates (1o,2O and $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { k H z }$ ，and necking was observed after each round of laser irradiation [32]. Hejmady etal.[33] observed neck formation between two isolated polymer particles over time by using a custom experimental setup in situ for laser sintering.In both experiments,laser was applied to two selected powder particles.The powder was picked up by using small-diameter glass pipette with vacuum.The packed powder was inserted onto a substrate for the laser process.This aspect remains largely unexplored and requires further investigation because it may provide valuable insights into neckbehaviour in LPBF process.\n\nIn this study, neck formation during laser sintering was explored by analysing the effects of different scanning speeds.The effects of laser parameters on necking growth between particles were then examined at different scanning speeds.The range of laser energy density indicates the amount of heat that the particles absorbed during the process.The results provide a theoretical basis for determining sintering mechanism and diffusion behaviours during the laser process.The findings of this study can help in understanding and reducing the defects that occur in the selective laser melting (SLM) process.Managing the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and cooling rates ensures fine grain structures and improved mechanical properties.Nowadays,SLM machines are limited to few materials with restricted parameter specifications.Therefore, understanding how the neck form between the particles can help improve the laser system where any laser can be used to melt or sinter particles with different properties.",

Laser power was set at 15 W,and the scanning speeds ranged from 150 $\\mathrm { { \\ m m } } / s$ (fastest) to $2 5 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ (slowest).Interparticle necking between the powder particles was observed at low laser power because high laser power would result in the solidification of melted parts and their merging with the powder bed which would hinder the observation of neck formation. In this study,the powder particle distribution was varied,and a low-power laser was used to observe the necking process to prevent overmelting and ensure only partial melting of individual tracks.Given that the powder size was $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and joining occurred only between particles,it was challenging to transfer the joined powder to the SEM machine.To address this,a copper tape was used to secure the joined powder,allowing for necking observation.The average neck size was then measured using ImageJ software,and only particles with an average size between 90 and $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ were selected for analysis. Table 1 shows the process parameters for the single-track experiment. The element distribution of each lasered sample was analysed with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy system (Oxford,UK) equipped in the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) system.",

In Fig.2(a),the scanning track was indistinct and lacked uniformity, indicating insuficient melting because of inadequate heat energy. This observation aligns with the findings of D.Wang et al.[37]，who demonstrated that high scanning speeds resulting from low energy input led to the partial melting of particles.Meanwhile,Yadroitsev etal. [38] showed that an inconsistent single track formed because of the formation of droplets. Fig.2(d) and (e) showcase a notably consistent scanning track,indicating successful melting as the scanning speed decreased. This decrease in scanning speed enabled powder particles to absorb more heat energy provided by the laser beam.Hence, extended exposure to heat energy allowed for controlled and stable melting,ensuring uniform and effective melting of powder particles and resulting in well-defined and consistent scanning tracks.The relationship between scanning speed and heat energy absorption plays a crucial role in selective laser melting,influencing the quality and uniformity of tracks produced [38,39].As the scanning speed decreased to $2 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s$ ，the scanning track lost stability and issues,such as balling,manifested.The slow speed caused excessive heating,resulting in a balling effect and considerable increase in track thickness.Kempen etal.[4O] highlighted that low scanning speeds with high energy inputs can distort scanning tracks because of increased recoil pressure,demonstrating the critical role of scanning speed in track continuity and occurrence of discontinuities at speeds below $5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s$ .",

This neck formation was highly affected by laser scanning speed. The trend of neck size over laser scanning speed is shown in Fig.4,in addition to the effect of different scanning speeds from fastest ( $\\mathrm { 1 5 0 } \\mathrm { m m } /$ s) to slowest $( 2 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s )$ .The neck size increased as scanning speed decreased.At laser power of $1 5 \\mathrm { W }$ and scanning speed of $1 5 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ ,the average neck size was $0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ because the scanning speed was extremely fast for the particles to absorb enough heat from the laser.This poor heat absorption at $1 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s$ led to an incomplete melting process because the energy to break the atom barrier for melting process is not enough.\n\nAs the laser speed decreased to $1 2 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s$ ，neck started to form. Fig.4(b) illustrates the formation of a small neck,whilst the particle shapes remained completely circular.At this stage,reducing the scanning speed slightly ensured that the powder particles had sufficient time to interact with the laser and absorb heat.This condition provided enough energy to overcome the surface energy barrier,breaking the atomic bonds at the small neck bridges,known as kinks, that formed between particles.These kinks created vacancies,leading to atom repositioning and smoothening the surfaces [41].The Young-Laplace law played a role in kink formation.The semi-liquid state of melted powder particles resulted ina hydrophilic outer surface,which attracted liquid from neighbouring particles and contributed to kink formation. Notably,large powder particles tended to exhibit pronounced kink formation because of Young-Laplace's law,where the larger particles often engulfed the smaller particles.",

The Bernouli's principle states that liquids have tendency to minimise or balance the difference in energy and pressure by flowing from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas.As shown in Fig.",

This mode of heat transfer can lead to the remelting of particles,adversely affecting final products.Consequently,issues,such as porosity and poor surface finish,may arise,compromising the quality and integrity of materials.According to Mazlan et al.'s study in 2023 [22],a high porosity value results in poor neck formation, leading to reduced mechanical strength and weakened planar interfaces between the layers.",

    "content": "The scanning speed of the laser played a critical role in neck formation.At slower scanning speeds,the particles absorb more heat due to higher energy density [44],resulting in a more stable heating process conducive to consistent neck formation.However,if the scanning speed was excessively slow or fast, it may cause either insufficient melting or over-melting,as illustrated in Fig.4.Thermal stability during neck growth was crucial for controlling the density of the material.An effective diffusion mechanism should progress from SD to VD,and finally to GBD.However,VD typically occured at a slower rate than GBD.Poor thermal stability could shorten the phase of VD,leading directly to GBD. This phenomenon could result in gas entrapment and pore coarsening,known as Ostwald ripening.Consequently,spherical pores were frequently observed in the final parts of printed SLM components.Therefore,moderate laser power with slow scanning speed is recommended because it ensures thermal stability during heating.This thermal stability is required for uniform neck formation and prevents overheating or underheating,which can lead to uneven neck growth and poor neck growth.",

    "content": "Fig.5 (a) shows the SD stage,where some particles were approximately close to one another.In the diffusion process,SD served as the initial and most critical stage in neck formation.This mechanism occured first because atoms located on the surface of particles absorb heat more rapidly compared to those within the bulk.Atoms on the surface of a material tended to move due to defects present at the atomic level.As the temperature rose,these loosely bound atoms started to break free and moved across the surface.SD,which involved this movement,required lower activation energy compared to other mass transport methods,making it more significant at lower temperatures [45].Consequently,surface atoms were more likely to melt before the interior atoms.The melting of these outer surface particles initiated the neck process,as it leads to the formation of a liquid bridge between adjacent particles.When low heat energy was applied, heat was initially absorbed by the particles,and atoms were excited,especially on the outer surface.Therefore,the partially melted outer surface areas with high surface tension were attracted to neighbouring partially melted outer surfaces.The formation of liquid bridges results in high surface energy in the neck regions.To reduce this surface energy,atoms will migrated away from the high-energy neck areas to regions of lower surface energy [46].This process caused the neck size to increase as the heating process progressed. Consequently, the volume of the partially melted particles detached from the core and formed kink,as shown in Fig.5 (d). This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the bridging effect [47].The bottom particle had a large kink because of its small size and high absorbed energy.The kink was concave.When the kink came in contact with a neighbouring kink,the hollow area in the middle was surrounded,and gas was entrapped.These conditions increased porosity during the deformation stage when the diffusion stage was incomplete.",

This process greatly affected the quality and integrity of final products,ensuring the proper filling of voids and enhancing the structural cohesion of materials.

    "content": "Once the process of VD resulted in the complete filling of hollow spaces and the melted core of both particles are were uniformly,GBD occurs.This process is faster than VD and promoted the densification of the sintering process [41].GBD accelerated the neck growth and material densification by enhancing atomic mobility along grain boundaries.This increased diffusion rate allowed for more effective particle bonding and reduced porosity,leading to larger neck sizes and a denser material with improved mechanical properties.In sintering with GBD, material moves from between particles to the neck surface.Pores released vacancies,which were then eliminated at the grain boundaries. This phenomenon caused mass to flow along the grain boundaries and deposit on the neck [41].\n\nTherefore,with suficient heat energy,GBD was completed,and two particles successfully merged into a spherical particle with a volume twice that of each original particle,as shown in Fig.5 (c).\n\nFig.5(g),(h) and (i) illustrate the progression of neck size,transition from a small diameter (SD) to a medium diameter (VD) and GBD (the largest diameter is ultimately reached).\n\nIn conclusion, effective neck formation and material density control in AM depended on the progression of diffusion mechanisms.SD occured on the particle surface and resulted in weak neck strength.VD,which happened internally,required more energy but significantly enhanced neck strength and diffusion.GBD,while important, did not fully enhance neck strength without sufficient VD.Thus,a balance of all three diffusion processes is crucial for achieving optimal material properties and minimising defects such as spherical pores.",

Therefore,Cr content percentage increased with neck size.",

    "content": "In conclusion, the evaporation of Ni and the subsequent increase in Cr content in SS316L could lead to increased brittleness and reduced mechanical strength due to Ni role in maintaining toughness [49]. Although Cr enhanced oxidation resistance,it was less effective than Ni in providing corrosion protection. These compositional changes could affect the material phase stability and overall performance.However, given that the percentage difference in composition is relatively small, the impact on the materials properties was expected to be minimal.\n\nTable 3 Chemical Composition of SS316L after laser treatment and neck size formation.   \n\n<table><tr><td>Sample</td><td colspan=\"3\">Chemical Composition (%)</td><td>Neck Size (μm)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Fe</td><td>Cr</td><td>Ni</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>51.5</td><td>14.1</td><td>9.7</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>49.0</td><td>14.3</td><td>9.5</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>53.8</td><td>14.9</td><td>7.2</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>44.3</td><td>22.2</td><td>5.5</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>55.8</td><td>17.6</td><td>7.0</td><td>100</td></tr></table>",

    "content": "# 4．Conclusion\nThis investigation focused on the effects of laser scanning speed on neck formation in laser-sintered SS3l6L powder particles.The results are summarised as follows.\n\n1.Scanning speed highly affected neck size and formation between powder particles.When a high scanning speed was used,powder particles were unable to absorb suficient heat energy for proper melting.By contrast,a low scanning speed allowed particles to absorb more heat efficiently for sufficient melting.   \n2.SD was the first diffusion mechanism in sintering,whereas neck started to form.In this stage,the neck was small,which consisted of onlyan outer thin layer composed of surface particles for diffusion. The neck strength was relatively weak. The neck size was approximately $4 9 \\mu \\mathrm { m } .$ ,whereas small amounts of energy was suficient for SD stages to occur because SD was a fast mechanism.   \n3.Another diffusion mechanism was VD.At these stages,difference in neck size was small.However,neck strength was relatively high because of the movement of the interior parts of the particles.   \n4.GBD was one of the important mechanisms in sintering.At $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } /$ s,neck size increased to $6 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .GBD resulted ina high neck size,and atoms were transported along the grain boundaries and promoted the densification of the materials.   \n5.Increase in energy density caused the evaporation of Ni to the environment. Hence,as the Ni content decreased, Cr percentage increased in the materials.",

    "content": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF） is now a well-established technique for producing metal components for practical use.Byutilizing the geometric flexibility of additive manufacturing (AM),a wide range of possibilities for part optimization using complex lattce-based structures are now available,allowing for performance improvements in various industries.Studies on such latice structures shows that the shape and size of parts and features have localized efects onresidual stresss,cooling rates inmelt pools, microstructure,and consequently, the mechanical properties of components.In the present work diferent TPMs (Gyroid,Diamond and Schwarz) lattice structures of a particular sub-millimetre cell size $( 7 0 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ were manufactured in two separate orientations $\\mathrm { 5 ^ { \\circ } }$ and $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ )to the build platform.Later,post processing methods like electropolishing (EP)was used on one set of specimens to improve the surface finish of the latices and remove un-melted and trapped powder particles from the latice.Heat treatment (HT) was employed on another setto enhance the tensile yield strength. These latice structures were used to probe the influence of thin features on their manufacturability and further the tensile properties of as-built (AB)and post processed samples.The tensile characteristics of both AB and EP samples were relatively similar,although the EP samples displayed marginally lower yield strength and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in most instances.The elastic modulus values varied between $7 . 5 \\mathrm { G P a }$ to 11 GPa for lattices constructed at $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ and $0 ~ ^ { \\circ }$ angles,respectively.In general, vertically constructed lattices exhibited superior UTs and percentage elongation compared to their horizontally built counterparts,except in the case of the schwarz latice.The analysis of fracture surface of diferent latice samples revealed a predominantly ductile transgranular fracture.",

    "content": "The development of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) based lattice structures has received a great deal of attention recently as a result of their distinctive mechanical and functional qualities [1-3]．These structures offer several advantages,such as high strength-to-weight ratio [4-6],improved heat transfer [7-9],and enhanced energy absorption [10-l2],making them suitable for various applications.A lattice consists of a size scalable unit with 3D repetition [l3] that can be surface or strut-based skeletal,depending on the nature of the connecting elements.They are advantageous for reducing part weight and controlling stiffness,because of complete local control over wall thickness,unit geometry,surface area,and volume fraction. McGregor et al., 2021 [14] put forth a comprehensive literature review discussing the natural lattice architecture of human bones and comparing it with the Titanium based lattice structures developed for bone replacement and repair. The text also provided a systematic classification of the different lattice designs into cellular and stochastic lattice architecture.Among different lattice designs the Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures have become popular due to their mathematical model-based design features which can be utilized to give them tailored properties by varying their cell size,shape and thickness.Moreover, TPMS structures are characterized by their zero mean curvature giving them smooth surfaces,free from sharp edges or junctions often found in traditional lattice structures [15,l6].Maskery et al. [17] conducted numerical investigation of such surface-based lattice structures with the objective of simplifying their design for additive manufacturing.",

    "content": "They developed a finite element model to predict the elastic modulus of the lattices in different directions and also observed that the cell geometry and cell orientation with respect to loading direction play a significant role in determining the elastic modulus of the lattice.Considering the advantages of the shape of these structures,the TPMS lattices exhibit a high degree of interconnectivity,with non-tortuous voids,which represent important advantages for a wide array of uses including the biomedical industry. TPMS structures possess a geometry and topology that closely resemble natural structures,making them particularly well-suited for a variety of biological applications [18].Recent advancements in LPBF technology have allowed for the production of highly complex and intricate lattice structures even with sub-millimetre feature sizes and high aspect ratios.However,the minimum feature sizes for a lattice appear to be limited by the LPBF processing parameters like laser spot diameter, laser power,scan speed and also the build orientation [2,19].",

    "content": "In a typical LPBF system, the laser creates a spot with a diameter of approximately $5 0 { \\mathrm { - } } 1 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } } ,$ and each layer has a thickness ranging between 30 and $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The production process involves rapidly melting and cooling the material in localized areas.As consecutive layers are added,the previously melted tracks are re-melted and solidified, resulting in a complex thermal history within a volumetric unit of material.The temperature in and close to the laser focal point can fluctuate from 400 to $2 5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { K } ,$ causing the metal to exist in solid, liquid,or gas states [2O].Apart from evaporative and radiative cooling,the thermal energy produced by the laser is dissipated from the molten pool through several routes,encompassing the component itself, the supportive structures, the build platform,and to a lesser degree,the loose powder enveloping the component. Consequently, the thermal history experienced by the material depends on its geometry,which can have localized effects on the microstructure,composition, mechanical behaviour,and residual stresses of the final part. This dependency on geometry becomes more pronounced as the size of the part features is reduced to sub-millimetre scales. Smaller geometries restrict the amount of heat-conducting powder surrounding the moving melt pool. Additionally, as the features become finer, the laser scanning pattern shifts from beingpredominantlyhatch-basedtobeingpredominantly contour-based.A study by Liu et al.[21] on the effect of powder on the cooling rates shows that for temperatures higher than $4 0 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ the effective thermal conductivity of powder increases with temperature. Further, it has also been reported that even the gas pressure maintained within the process chamber can significantly impact the conductivity of the powder where Wei et al.",

Puttonen et al. [3] manufactured SS 316 L based TPMS lattice structures to study the impact of feature size and shape on susceptibility to corrosion and its localization in space and used a graded porosity lattice design to perform tensile testing of these structures.They found that among the three different wall thickness (0.867,0.515,and $0 . 3 2 3 \\mathrm { m m }$ )manufactured the lattice with $0 . 3 2 3 \\mathrm { m m }$ wall thickness displayed aggressive pitting.However, the tensile results did not indicate any clear signs of latent corrosion impact on mechanical behaviour.Though in this domain also,the manufacturing of submillimetre cell sized lattice structures still remains less examined. Smaller the cell size of lattice structures,higher the relative density which is expected to provide higher strength.However,as the cell size reduces the dimensions of elements in the unit cell come closer to the laser spot diameter and the irregularities in printing like powder attachment rises [3].",

Defects like strut waviness (offset of the cross-section centres from designed strut axis) is shown to adversely impact the elastic modulus of the lattice.The down-skin surfaces are the ones facing the build platform and while printing these features the powder present in the layers below gets agglomerated at the down-skin region due to diffusion of heat and causes dimensional inaccuracies [28-3O].Apart from these defects,for thin lattice structures with struts of ${ \\sim } 2 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ Mahmoud et al.[31] also observed uneven bulging melt tracks on the struts due to balling effect which occurs due to insuficient wetting of previous track by the molten metal which solidifies as spherical beads pertaining to surface tension. The presence of internal defects like porosity,lack of fusion is mitigated by optimizing the LPBF process parameters but the elimination of surface irregularities caused due to differential cooling rates,powder attachment,undercuts over the lattice elements are less addressed.For these defects,post-processing techniques like electropolishing provide great advantages as it has the capacity to evenly remove material throughout the intricacies of the lattice structure.",

Consequently, rough edges may appear at the bottom surface of the lattice junctions.To evaluate the printability of the lattices,the relative density of the as-built test coupons was measured as an initial assessment.\n\n![](images/0dcc212a052d560e1fc943670adb8cd94de3b93a18674c4ce6ed9c67791eb99c.jpg)  \nFig12.Mea structures are arranged.\n\n![](images/45d28888ed5b45e41a9ca2ffe07b9d35765f56e525a4124bb097466aaea7fdb1.jpg)  \nFig.13.Optical micrographs of (a)& (c) As-built and (b) & (d) Heat treated.\n\nThe relative density measurements,conducted by dry weighing of the as-built lattices,demonstrated aclose agreement with the theoretical values (see Fig.7).This suggests that ata macro level, one can anticipate good printability,even for sub-millimeter TPMS latices using SS 17-4 ph material.To quantify the deviation between the as-built and postprocessed lattices,measurements for strut diameter and void size were taken as indicated in Fig.2.The strut diameterand void size exhibit an inverse relationship;a reduction in strut diameter leads to an increase in void size.As depicted in Fig.8,the HB samples exhibited greater deviation from the designed dimensions for all lattices compared to the VB samples.However, the variation in the diamond lattice was nearly equal for both build orientations.",

    "content": "This deviation could potentially be attributed to the presence of struts positioned at a $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ angle to the build direction.Research has indicated that struts built at a $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ angle to the build platform tend to offer better dimensional accuracy compared to other orientations [28]. Notably, the Schwarz lattice exhibited the maximum deviation due to the inclusion of both horizontal and vertical struts in its design.Upon closer inspection,it was observed that the variation in dimensions did not stem from surface defects or unmelted particles but was primarily a result of thinner as-built features compared to the designed dimensions. This thinning of lattice features is likely caused by high thermal gradients during the L-PBF process,inducing shrinkage upon solidification. These thermal gradients tend to be more pronounced in horizontally built samples,given their increased surface area contact with the build plate.Consequently,this could be the reason for the higher geometric deviation in HB lattices.\n\n![](images/6b5812fc3369ef673b6947ff396adeb7a1be3be829c017dcb3c3b8c691f955f3.jpg)  \nFig.14.Engineering stress-strain plots for samples built at $0 ^ { \\circ }$ and $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ to the build platform for as-built,electropolished and heat-treated conditions.(a) Gyroid (b) Diamond and (c) Schwarz TPMS structures.\n\nIn such scenarios, post-processing methods such as electropolishing can be employed to eliminate unmelted powder particles and refine the surface.However,caution must be exercised to avoid excessive thinning of lattice features,as observed in the current study,which could potentially reduce the overall strength of the specimen.The difference between the surface features of samples built at $0 ^ { \\circ }$ (horizontal) and $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ (vertical) to the build plate can be observed from Fig.9.",

    "content": "Horizontally built (HB) samples exhibit smoother surfaces compared to vertically built (VB) samples.The presence of attached powder particles exacerbates geometric inaccuracies during the manufacturing of lattice features.These inaccuracies are more pronounced on surfaces parallel to the building direction than on surfaces perpendicular to it, mainly due to the presence of partially sintered surrounding powder particles.Fig.9 illustrates that the quantity of residual powder particles attached to the surface varies with the lattice's shape,primarily influenced by the differing feature sizes of each lattice type. Cooling rates are impacted by the sizes of different lattice elements,where thinner features result in less effective cooling.Furthermore,the heat from the laser spot affects not only the solidified part but also the surrounding powder and the material from the layer beneath,leading to an uneven surface with partially melted powder particles and clusters of fused powder. Moreover,smaller void sizes (ranging from 150 to $3 5 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } } )$ increase the likelihood of entrapped powder particles within the structure.This can be visually confirmed by examining the lattice against a bright light source,where open voids are distinctly visible for all lattices,confirming the absence of entrapped powder particles,at least ata macro scale.",

    "content": "In this study,two distinct post-processing methods were employed. Electropolishing (EP) aimed to eliminate residual powder particles from voids and enhance the overall lattice surface finish,while heat treatment was performed to enhance the mechanical characteristics of the specimen,compensating for any impact the lattice might have on the part's strength.During the electropolishing process,the acid in the electrolyte solution interacts with the metal on the lattice structure's surface, causing it to dissolve.This dissolution effectively removes surface defects or roughness,resulting in a smoother and more polished surface. The process successfully eliminated significant portions of unmelted and loosely bound powder particles from the lattice structure's surface, exposing defects like undercut surfaces previously covered by partially sintered powder particles.These defects can act as sites for stress concentration, potentially initiating cracks under external loads.Moreover, this method proved useful in removing trapped powder from the lattice's thin features.Fig.1O provides a clear visual difference between the as-built and EP features of the three TPMS lattice structures.As depicted in the figure,the process resulted in void size enlargement due to the uniform removal of material from all faces of the lattice.\n\nThis observation is further supported by metallographic sections obtained from HB and VB lattices in both as-built and EP conditions,as depicted in Figs.11 and 12.Sections from EP samples exhibita reduced distribution of powder particles surrounding the lattices.Additionally, these sections reveal characteristic features such as up-skin and downskin formations,especially noticeable in overhang regions.Furthermore,phenomena like dross formation defects are evident,primarily occurring on downward-facing surfaces due to inadequate heat dissipation.",

This variance in layer-to-layer time intervals gives rise to a substantial contrast in terms of thermal history,specifically impacting the rate of cooling and aging temperature of the previously solidified powder. With a longer time,there is more opportunity for the heat to disperse, resulting in a gradual reduction in temperature at the conclusion of each printed layer as the time interval increases.This decrease in temperature of previously melted layers elevates the thermal gradient between the molten pool and the adjacent solid material. Consequently,higher cooling rates occur,driven by augmented heat exchange with the surroundings and previously molten layers,as outlined by Yadollahi etal. in their work [36].",

Moreover, the vertically built S-V series structures showed large variation in modulus value in the range of 14-36 GPa due to their unpredictable behaviouras discussed.For electro-polished parts the modulus values were slightly lower and for HT lattices were marginally higher. The impact of heat treatment was more pronounced for vertically built gyroid and diamond lattices.The G-V and D-V series lattices had lower modulus values when compared to their Hz counterparts.However, this gap was successfully reduced by employing the heat treatment regime.

    "content": "The analysis of fracture surfaces also revealed defects like porosities present in the latices. Sometimes due to recoil pressure induced by metal evaporation,accompanied by the ejection of smaller droplets (spatters) a portion of metal gets displaced to adjacent region [43,44]. This displaced metal leaves a pore behind due to restricted flow of molten metal back to the original spot.This pore is referred to as a keyhole type porosity.Previous studies have shown that this porosity leaves a series of pores irrespective of build direction [38,45].Also, during the LPBF process,as a result of the vaporisation of low melting point metal constituents,gas bubbles may occur in the melt pool. Entrapment of gases has also been observed due to rapid melting and cooling occurring in LPBF.The spherical porosities observed in Fig.17 are a by-product of these entrapped gases.\n\nConsidering the defects in samples built at $0 ^ { \\circ }$ and $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ orientation, the fracture surface of schwarz lattice built at $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ revealed large crater like holes as shown in Fig.19.Un-melted or partially melted powder particles may be trapped in the un-overlapped areas between neighbouring melt pools during the SLM process by inadequate melting.The existence of these low-density region encompassing the molten pool makes them prone to be pulled out while tensile testing leaving behind a crater like hole.Similar phenomenon was also noticed in the study by Zhong et al. (2016)[46].By altering the input scanning parameters,the severity of such flaws can be reduced,but they are challenging to completely eradicate.Such defects were more frequent in Schwarz lattices built at $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ which could be the reason for unpredictable behaviour of S-V series lattices.",

Conclusions\nThree different TPMS lattice structures (Gyroid,Diamond and Schwarz) with a cell size of $7 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and in two orientation ( $[ 0 ^ { \\circ }$ and $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ to the build platform were successfully manufactured using LPBF process.At macroscopic level the relative densities of as-built samples were in good agreement with the theoretical values.Based on the microscopic and mechanical analysis,following conclusions were drawn.\n\ni. The manufacturability of lattices was compromised due to thin feature sizes,resulting in a significant presence of partially melted or completely un-melted powder particles on the surface.   \nii.Electropolishing successfully removed these particles,yet the process led to a minor reduction in overall strength and elongation of the lattice due to further thinning of struts postparticle removal. To counter this effect, compensatory measures could be implemented during the design stage,necessitating further analysis as a future scope.   \niii.Among the three structures,Gyroid and Diamond exhibited consistent results under tensile testing.However, the Schwarz structure's vertically built samples failed abruptly due to structural defects.   \niv.Heat treatment proved effective in enhancing the yield strength and hardness of lattice structures,albeit at the expense of reduced ductility.   \nv.In conclusion,manufacturing sub-millimeter lattices using LPBF presents challenges,particularly regarding powder attachment over the surface.This study proposed a viable method to address this issue through post-processing techniques like Electropolishing.However,further optimization is essential to establish amore predictable methodology and attain desired properties in the final part.",

This method was developed at the University of Sheffield and has enabled the processing of Ti6Al4V powder with $8 0 8 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ and $4 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ diode lasers previously [4-6]. This paper presents,for the first time,an in-depth study of the capabilities of the technology when processing stainless steel 316L (SS316L),a material extensively researched and processed for industrial applications using LPBF.316L's notable use in industry is due to its superior corrosion resistance [7],biocompatibility [8], strength,and cost-effectiveness [9]. SS316L is commonly preferred as an implant material in the medical field due to its excellent corrosion resistance and biocompatibility [10].Further research is being conducted on surface treatments for SS316L implants,such as electropolishing [11] and ion implantation [1O], to enhance their pitting resistance.Moreover, additively manufactured SS316L enables the production of complex geometries,making it suitable for scaffolds used in bone defect repair and joint replacements [12].Additionally, the superior pitting resistance of SS316L makes it a preferred material for use in corrosive environments, particularly in welding applications [13, 14].Additionally, numerical studies have been conducted to optimize and model the welding process of austenitic stainless steel [15].D'Andrea [16] reported that $4 0 . 7 \\%$ of SS316L applications are in the petrochemical and chemical industries, $2 1 . 5 \\%$ in marine onshore and offshore environments, $1 4 . 1 \\%$ in biomedical applications,and $9 . 5 \\%$ in the automobile sector.",

    "content": "The laser absorptivity of metal surfaces is found to be significantly influenced by the wavelength of the laser employed [17]. The absorptivity of Ti6Al4V powder was increased by $1 4 \\%$ when employing an $8 0 8 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ diode laser during DAM compared to traditional LPBF [5]. Furthermore,an additional $1 1 \\%$ increase was observed when $4 5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ blue diode lasers were used in place of $8 0 8 \\mathrm { n m }$ diode lasers [5]. Brandau et al.[18] investigated the absorbance of 39 different powders, varying grain sizes,at 2O different laser wavelengths. The absorptivity of the SS316L powder was measured at $7 8 . 4 \\%$ using $4 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ diode lasers and at $7 1 . 2 \\%$ using $1 0 7 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ fibre lasers [18].\n\nThe laser power requirement for the fabrication of multilayer parts with LPBF is hundreds of watts [19-21], DAM enables the processing of single tracks and multi-layer parts with $3 . 5 { \\mathrm { - } } 4 . 5 \\mathrm { W }$ of power from a single-diode laser [5, 6] but scans across the powder bed at much lower speeds.In addition to laser power,it is important to discuss the differences in other process parameters, such as laser spot size, between DAM and traditional LPBF. Generally, the laser spot size in LPBF processing ranges from $5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $2 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ [22-26]. In some cases, the laser spot size can increase up to $4 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ [27].In DAM, the laser spot size cannot be determined in the same way as in LPBF due to the integration of multiple diode lasers.It is influenced by the number of lasers used in the processing and is certainly wider compared to traditional LPBF,particularly in the direction perpendicular to the scanning direction.",

    "content": "The cooling rate of LPBF is typically within the range of $1 0 ^ { 3 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { K ~ s ^ { - 1 } }$ [28]. The cyclic thermal history (i.e. rapid cooling and heating) and cooling rate of the traditional LPBF process have a significant impact on the microstructure of the resulting parts [29]. Vysotskiy et al. validated the efficacy of reducing the cooling rate through building direction to observe $\\alpha$ -martensite in $1 7 { - } 4 ~ \\mathrm { P H }$ samples [30]. The rapid cooling rate of Ti6Al4V results in the formation of a $\\acute { \\alpha }$ martensite microstructure [31]. In contrast to traditional LPBF processes,the cooling rate in DAM is significantly lower, measured at $6 0 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C / s }$ during the processing of Ti6Al4V [4]. The custom laser head assembly in DAM is intentionally designed to facilitate both preheating and post-heating, as well as remelting [4]. The remelting of the previously created track, facilitated by the laser beam geometry and hatch distance in DAM, leads to a slower cooling rate. This controlled cooling rate plays a crucial role in customising the microstructure of the parts. Caglar et al.[6] and Alsaddah et al.[5] successfully observed the $\\beta$ -phase in Ti6Al4V due to a slower cooling rate in DAM.Additionally, the elevated cooling rate associated with LPBF applications has the potential to preclude the observation of the second phase, namely δ-ferrite,in SS316L samples [32].Nevertheless, rapid solidification has resulted in the formation of finer microstructures in the resulting parts [33]. The mechanical properties of LPBF parts with a finer microstructure than wrought samples,having higher yield strength and ultimate tensile strength [34].",

    "content": "One of the most important key process parameters in terms of single-layer formation is the hatch distance to eliminate poor connections between adjacent melt tracks. In addition,the hatch distance/melt pool overlap should not be set too high/low to produce fully melted structures without defects.Increasing the melt pool overlap increases the number of melt tracks on the manufactured part, which can have a negative effect on surface roughness [45]. Three different hatch distance values are used to understand melt track overlap to produce single-layer formation. $2 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ， $3 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and $4 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (HD200, HD300 and HD400) are the hatch distance parameters in this work (see Table 4). The melt track overlap between each laser track is calculated using Eq. 6.In this study, the beam profile width $( b _ { w } )$ is assumed to be equal to the melt track width. According to previous research on processing Ti6Al4V in DAM [4], no significant difference exists between the two.Another reason for this assumption is the lack of capability for in-situ measurements of the melt pool width during processing. Then,Eq.7 is used to calculate the hatch distance according to the melt track overlap $( m _ { o } )$ in microns.HD200, HD300,and HD400 correspond to $6 0 \\%$ ， $4 0 \\%$ ，and $2 0 \\%$ beam overlap respectively. Dong et al. highlighted the clear distinction between melt tracks, noting no overlap between them [46]. Furthermore,it was demonstrated that even $4 0 \\%$ melt track overlap results in enhanced top surface morphology in terms of surface roughness. However, additional overlapping reduces the strength and plasticity of LPBF parts due to the formation of microcracks [46]. It has been demonstrated that a $2 5 { - } 5 0 \\%$ overlap results in a stress release effect due to the re-scanning of previously scanned areas [47]. However, excessive overlap can prevent the preheating effect on a later track from the previous one.",

Ten measurements are taken from each microscope,comprising both deep and shallow parts of the melt track geometry. The results are averaged and are presented in the bottom right corner of the micrographs in Fig. 4. Further micrographs, spanning the range from SS30O to SS4Oo,are not included here due to space limitations. It is evident that an increase in hatch distance results in a transformation of the cross-section of samples into a wave structure.This fluctuation is further emphasised by the addition of vertical red dotted lines in Figs. 4(c), (e),and (f). The relative density values and normalised energy density values are provided in the upper right and left corners of Figs. 4(a) to (s), respectively. It can be observed that the relative density values of both samples exceed $9 9 \\%$ . Furthermore, the normalised energy density values exhibit a notable decline,ranging from 9.12 to 0.46, across the samples from SS50HD200 to SS500HD400 due to an increase in scanning speed and hatch distance.",

As the scanning speed is increased, the energy density values decrease (for details,please refer to the top left corner of Figs. 4(a) to 4(s)). Accordingly, the melt track depth trend exhibits a downward trajectory from SS50 to SS150. The reduction in the melt track depth is also attributed to scanning speed, as demonstrated by Alsaddah et al.[5]. Furthermore, the depth of the melt track observed in the samples increases following the SS15o.This is attributed to the balling issue,which has been previously validated in other DAM studies conducted at the single-layer formation section of Ti6Al4V [6].",

    "content": "The presence of minor spherical pores is indicated by red circles in samples treated with HD200 (see Figs. 6(a), (d),(g),(j)). In contrast, the number of spherical pores observed in samples treated with HD30O is relatively low in comparison to the number of pores present in HD200 samples.These pores are represented by blue circles in Figs.6(b),and (e)).Furthermore,a slight decrease in porosity is observed with an increase in scanning speed at samples with HD2OO (see the first column of Fig. 6). The porosity of the samples containing HD2Oo is found to be greater at slower scanning speeds.Porosity in LPBF samples can be classfied into three main categories: gas porosity, lack of fusion,and delamination between subsequent layers [51]. Pores that originated in samples with HD200 can be identified as gas porosity, given their spherical shape and the conditions under which they occurred (single-layer formation). An excessive degree of overlap in the melt track can result in a notable rise in temperature within the melt pool, which may subsequently give rise to several thermal issues [52].It is hypothesized that the elevated temperature in the melt pool at slow scanning speeds results in vaporization.The spherical shape of the gas porosity is the result of the entrapped gas caused by the vapour pressure [53]. It is also stated that too low hatch distance at slow scanning leads to a decrease in relative density [54]. As the scanning speed is increased, the porosity of the samples with HD3oO shows a slight increase (see the second column in Fig.6) like the literature work in LPBF SS316L [55]. Additionally, some discontinuities are observed at the base of the sample (see the blue rectangles in Figs. 6(h) and (k)).An additional increase in hatch distance results in the formation of distinct cross-sectional divisions within the samples (as illustrated by the green rectangles in Figs. 6(f),(i),and (l)).",

In particular, when the energy input is below 1.52, there is a marked increase in surface roughness (see Figs.7(l) and (m) or Figs.7(n) to (o)) as a result of a lack of fusion [25].

Consequently, the values are mapped onto constant NED values to ensure consistency across the data set.Normalised energy density values for literature works typically range from 4.641 to 14.32 (see Table 1),enabling the fabrication of high-density $( > 9 9 \\% )$ samples.DAM facilitates the processing of fully melted and fused single-layer parts from 0.61 to 9.12 in terms of NED value,utilizing $4 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ blue diode lasers (the absorptivity of the SS316L powder increases by approximately $1 0 \\%$ when a $4 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ diode laser is employed instead of a $1 0 7 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ fiber laser [18]).It is also relevant to note that the DAM SS316L samples fabricated in this study are of a single-layer structure. The energy requirement for multi-layer SS316L samples may be higher than that for single layers.",

This is illustrated in Fig.1O,which presents several surface contours.It can be seen that Ra values for HD200 increase from $3 . 4 6 9 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $1 1 . 5 3 7 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ between SS5O and SS250.An additional increase in scanning speed results in an elevation of surface roughness to $2 8 . 5 4 6 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ when the scanning speed reaches $3 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m } /$ min,as illustrated in Fig. 1O. Increased scanning speeds result in the formation of discontinuities and non-uniformity in the melt tracks,which can be attributed to balling defects [48, 5O]. The occurrence of balling problems and discontinuity problems is illustrated in Figs.7(l) to (s).A similar phenomenon is observed in both hatch distances, with surface roughness increasing significantly from $6 . 5 7 7 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $5 1 . 7 1 8 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ and from $1 3 . 8 1 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $4 9 . 0 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ for HD300 and $\\mathrm { H D 4 0 0 }$ ,respectively, while SS50 to SS500 (see Table 5).",

In addition to LPBF, samples manufactured by alternative methods, including casting [67] and electron beam melting [68,69], do not display the delta ferrite phase in their X-ray diffraction analysis.The presence of the small δ ferrite phase has also been documented in some of the literature on LPBF of SS316L,as referenced in [32, 39, 61, 62]. The ferrite phase is typically resistant to high temperatures,and the traditional LPBF process is unable to provide an adequate duration for the transformation into an austenitic phase [62]. Consequently, the observation of subsequent phases on samples may be prevented by the implementation of a high cooling rate at traditional LPBF [32]. It is anticipated by LPBF that the S ferrite phase may serve to reinforce the $\\gamma$ austenite phase,which is susceptible to deformation [39, 62].It has also been found that delta ferrite in austenitic steel welds increases the resistance to stress corrosion cracking caused by tensile stress in corrosive environments [70].",

[25] examined both the grain size and the cell size within the grain for only one specific grain.It was revealed that the grain size increased from $2 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ in length and $1 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ in width $\\mathrm { t o } > 0 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ in length and $5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in width,while the energy density increased from $5 8 \\ J / m m ^ { 3 }$ to $2 0 3 . 1 J / m m ^ { 3 }$ ： Additionally, the cell size was observed to increase from $3 6 1 \\pm 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ to $5 7 5 \\pm 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ at the same energy density increases were valid [25]. Larimian et al.

    "content": "This paper presents evidence of the small-scale manufacturing capability of DAM in SS316L,which is a highly desirable attribute in traditional LPBF processes due to its enhanced corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. SS316L represents a novel chapter in the field of DAM, exhibiting a higher density than its predecessor, Ti6Al4V feedstock. The DAM process enables the fabrication of fully melted and fused SS316L parts. It is observed that DAM enables a $9 9 . 9 9 \\%$ dense part. It has been demonstrated that DAM represents a promising alternative to LPBF for the fabrication of samples with lower energy density requirements, due to the higher laser absorptivity of SS316L powder at a wavelength of $4 5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ . The microstructural investigation reveals the significant presence of a δ ferrite phase,in addition to the main $\\gamma$ austenite phase in SS316L. This suggests that the presence of S ferrite is evident in samples produced with varying energy inputs, without any coincidental procedures in previous LPBF works. It is hypothesized that a reduced cooling rate results in the formation of the S ferrite phase.The presence of delta-ferrite in austenitic stainless-steel welds prevents cracking due to tensile stress in corrosive environments. The inherently slower cooling rate of DAM also results in an increase in the size of the cellular structure at the sub-grain level in comparison to LPBF work.While the cellular size in LPBF counterparts does not exceed $2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,the DAM samples display a cellular size of $3 { \\mathrm { - } } 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The present study compares the surface roughness and microhardness of DAM samples with those of LPBF samples from the literature.The sample with a slower scanning speed (SS5O) and lower hatch distance (HD200) yielded superior results in terms of top surface defects and surface roughness measurements, with a value of $3 . 4 6 9 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .",
