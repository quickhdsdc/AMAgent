    "content": "Various investigations have revolved around SLM Ti-6Al-4V because of its high usage in different industries;Thijs etal.studied the impact of scanning strategy and process parameters on the microstructure of Ti-6Al-4V during SLM processing.They found that the relationship between the fracture plane and build orientation is very noticeable when the material is tested as-built. Stress relief by low temperature annealing heat treatment improves resistance against the growth of fatigue cracks and fracture toughness [12].Zhao et al. compared the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti-6AL-4 V alloy manufactured by SLM and Electron Beam Melting (EBM). It is evident from their work that tensile strength of SLM parts is higher than EBM because of finer $\\acute { \\alpha }$ martensite.Porosity in SLM parts is associated with different scanning strategies and build orientations.Additionally, SLM and EBM Ti-6AL- $_ { 4 \\mathrm { V } }$ samples in vertical orientation show higher tensile strength and ductility as compared to horizontal orientation because of the change in tensile axial direction relative to the prior $\\beta$ grain orientation [13].Some researchers use grade 5 Ti-6AL-4V powder in their work to investigate the growth rate of fatigue cracks and fracture toughness.Because of anisotropic residual stress distribution,the influence of fatigue crack growth and relation between fracture toughness plane and build direction were very noticeable.Annealing heat treatment and low-temperature stress-relief enhances the resistance against fatigue cracks and fracture toughness [12]. Simonelli et al. showed the tensile properties influenced by microstructure.They found that the build orientation influences tensile properties,especially ductility.Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) results show that intergranular fracture is present along the grain boundaries,which explains the main fracture surface features normally observed in fracture SLM of Ti-6AL-4V[1].",

    "content": "For enhancing the mechanical properties of AM Ti-6AL-4V, Xu et al. worked on in-situ decomposition in which unfavourable $\\acute { \\alpha }$ martensite changed into $( \\alpha + \\beta )$ microstructure.The best mechanical properties are achieved by lamellar $( \\alpha + \\beta )$ microstructure and performance is better than most of the AM manufactured Ti-6AL-4V alloys [14]. Mertens et al. compared the mechanical properties of SLM Ti-6AL-4 V alloy and $3 1 6 \\mathrm { L }$ stainless steel manufactured under similar conditions. The behaviour of titanium alloy was more complex than steel concerning mechanical anisotropy.Titanium alloy shows more sensitivity to the internal stresses as compared to $3 1 6 \\mathrm { L }$ stainless steel because of low thermal conductivity [15].For biomedical applications,Murr et al. researched on mechanical behaviour and microstructure of Ti-6AL-4 V using both EBM and SLM procedures.The inclusion of α, $\\beta$ and $\\acute { \\alpha }$ martensitic phases,compared to wrought material,increases the hardness from HRC 37 to 57 and tensile strength from 0.9 to $1 . 4 5 \\mathrm { G P a }$ [16].Qiu et al. studied the microstructure and tensile properties of Ti6AL-4V manufactured by SLM and hot isostatic pressing (HIP).Horizontally manufactured samples show more porosity then vertically manufactured parts [17].The HIPing process closes most of the pores and completely changes the martensite into $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ phases.Leuder et al.researched on the mechanical behaviour of SLM Ti-6AL- $4 \\mathrm { V }$ to analyse the crack initiation and crack growth.In SLMof Ti-6AL-4V, the process initially formed $\\acute { \\alpha }$ martensite,which makes the microstructure unfavourable because it has low ductility.Porosity reduction through HIPing leads to prominent crack-initiation-phase extension and improves the fatigue strength by reducing internal stresses during crack growth [18].",

    "content": "# 2.3.Post-processing (heat treatment)\nIn additive manufacturing of metals, the periodic cooling and heating of subsequent layers during the build process leads to change in microstructure and storage of residual stresses within the samples. Moreover,the fast cooling rate,specifically for powder bed systems compared to blown powder,generates more intermetallic phases which can be reduced by heat treatment[19,2O].Table 3 illustrates the heat treatment conditions that were used in this experiment.In this instance, the heating and resident time were fixed at $1 2 0 \\mathrm { m i n } .$ ，so the heating gradient steadily increased from ambient temperature $( 2 0 ^ { \\circ } )$ to the set temperature from 4.8 to $8 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { ^ { \\circ } C / m i n }$ .The cooling rate was fixed at $5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } /$ min across all samples to prevent major changes to the mechanical properties, so cooling time varied for each sample set [21].\n\n# 2.4.Hardness testing\nThe DuraJet G5 macro hardness tester for Brinell hardness measurement with versatility,incremental turnaround time and repeatability was used.

    "content": "Normal probability analysis [22] is a graphical technique for analysing whether or not the obtained data has normal,Weibull distribution or something else.In this method,the data are plotted versus theoretical distribution in such a way that the points should stay around the straight line and any deviations from this line show a departure from the normal distribution.Probability plots can be plotted for different distributions to check the dispersion of the data set on each distribution.In this experiment we plotted our data for normal,Weibull and lognormal distributions and found the distribution trend of our data is similar.Therefore,in Fig.3 the probability analysis fora normal distribution is shown.The confidence intervals on the probability plot were selected at $9 5 \\%$ .This is shown by outer lines on the plot and is used to find the accuracy of the individual percentile assumption.As it can be seen the dispersion of the data set for hardness is similar to relative density which corresponds to the results of Fig.2.

    "content": "# 3.2. Main effect analyses\nIn statistics and design of experiments,the main effect is of an independent parameter on a dependent variable (such as hardness,relative density, tensile strength, breaking elongation and average surface)averaging across the levels of any other independent variables.In accordance with any design of experiment under the analysis of variance,a mean effect analysis assesses the hypotheses for evidence of an effect of different treatments regarding fluctuations.As it can be seen in Fig.4 the main effect plot for average hardness for each variable is almost the same as relative density which is shown using red lines. There are some small differences in the behaviour of the scan pattern angle and laser power (only in one value) which proves that the fluctuations of process parameters have a similar effect on the values of hardness and density. From Figs.2-4(A-E) it is found that variation of process parameters for hardness is highly similar to density.However,a mean effect test only shows whether overall there is something about a particular variable that is producing the difference.Therefore,in the next step,a comprehensive discussion on the interaction effect of each process parameter on the hardness and relative density will show the tie-in and mechanisms behind these two factors.\n\nAnother difference between the mean values of relative density and hardness is related to the fluctuations.As it can be seen in Fig.4(A) the fluctuations for relative density are bigger which shows the larger impact of process parameters on this factor.Fig.4(A and B) also shows the highest influence on the results is associated with heat treatment,and this parameter is more dominant on hardness and density.\n\n# 4.Discussions\n",

The amount of $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ martensite in these samples,due to lower temperature and the cooling rate,is lower.Therefore,the mean value of hardness for low energy density samples that is shown in Fig.5(A) is about $1 2 \\%$ less than as-built samples with higher energy density.Fig.5(C and D) show the microstructure of as-built and beta heat treated samples.As it can be shown the fine microstructure in as-built and coarse for beta heat treatment was observed.",

    "content": "Fig.7(A and B) show the interaction of hatch space and heat treatment versus hardness and density. Small hatch space starts with lower density related to high overlap.Also,Fig.7(A) shows that most hardness fluctuations are related to the variation of heat treatment.This also shows that heat treatment had the stronger impact which is proved by mean effect diagrams (Figs.4 and 5).By increasing hatch space, hardness increased and then reduced.In the overlap area, the material is mushy and no micro-flow motion occurs due to higher viscosity.In this case,higher heat penetration due to lack of Marangoni's convention leads to the generation of bubbles and vapour in the melting pool. The bubbles tend to escape from the melting pool and the interaction of vapour force,versus hydrostatic pressure $^ +$ surface tension (Fig.8) leads to the formation of keyholes and decreasing hardness.The vapour pressure has a direct relation with the diameter of the keyhole and in lower diameter, higher pressure on the pores leads to the generation of high force and as shown in Fig.8 the vapour moves to the topmost surface of melting pool to escape and overcome to hydrostatic and surface tension forces, thus creating keyholes.\n\nIn higher than optimum hatch spaces lower hardness was obtained. This is related to higher energy dispersion over a bigger surface and lower remelting of subsequent layers.Fig.7(D) shows nonlinear behaviour for the interaction of scan pattern angle and heat treatment versus hardness.Here,two-dimensional graphs were plotted to clarify this situation (Fig.9).In this figure,the best hardness is related to area 2, which occurs around the stress relieving temperatures and shows the impact of heat treatment on hardness.In lower scan pattern angle higher hardness was seen and by moving across the Y-direction the average value of hardness decreases.",

    "content": "This can be related to higher overlap between subsequent layers. When the lower scan pattern angle is selected, then the hatch space is much more coincident with the former layer. In this case,the overlap area of the second layer is mostly sitting on the first layer and two further laser crossings occur. Therefore, this leads to double remelting on the overlap of the former layers and possible removal of keyholes and pores.As a result, the hardness improves [19,20].\n\n![](images/766a7a9ef1c2f80ba47783821466a3fc627df648d442ec3a3d5c469f499c9a1d.jpg)  \nFig.5Meaotsssityocufpse Beta annealed samples.\n\n![](images/50a0d0ff8c0cc463083eee7b3dbcb0e203eaab54629f292af8f7d60b0fb81735.jpg)  \nFig.6.Interaction plots for hardness and density for heat treatment versus laser power and scan speed.\n\n4.3. The effect of scan pattern angle on process parameters\n\nFigure (A) shows for the interaction of scan pattern angle and lasei power the best hardness (higher values) was obtained with lower scan pattern angle and higher laser power.Also,with low laser power and high scan speed,hardness reduced to 25oHB which is about $1 5 \\%$ reduction.This area suffers from a lack of re-melting and fusion and these two phenomena strengthens the correlation.A similar trend was obtained for the density that is shown in Fig.10(B).\n\n![](images/6c34bbe228fbaddd2d6fdef95bb0b118196bc6c98c19134d21f406b4d36ac313.jpg)  \nFig.7. Interaction plots for hardnes and density for heat treatment versus hatch space and patern angle.\n\nFig.lO(C and D) show the similar trend for interaction between scan speed and pattern angle. Some peaks occurred in the higher scan speed and low pattern angle for both hardness and density. This can be associated with better coverage of overlaps of previous layers that leads to double remelting,and reduction of some defects such as cracks,keyholes and pores. This effect seems to compensate for the lack of wettability in higher scan speeds.",

This area is a fertile ground for porosity since the energy density has very small values and so the chance of formation of big pores due to lack of fusion is higher.On the other side,higher scan speed leads to Rayleigh instability specifically in the low energy area,and porosity increases and hardness decreases.Scrutinizing Fig.11(A) shows some peaks happened toward a certain direction along the maximum value of laser power,which proves this parameter is more influential than scan speed on the value of hardness.\n\nIn terms of the interaction of laser power and hatch space from analytical 3D graphs, the complex behaviour was obtained. Contour plots in 2D have been plotted to show the linear behaviour of the process (Fig. l2). This figure shows that increasing hatch space up to a certain point (darker area) improves the density.Larger hatch space leads to larger contact between the melting pool and solidified layer.

    "content": "# 5.Conclusions\nIn this research,based on ASTM standards,a relevant DoE was chosen and 25 samples with five repetitions for each were printed. The process parameters were laser power,scan speed,hatch space and scan pattern angle,and were selected in five repetitions.To tailor mechanical properties,heat treatment also was selected as one of the variables for these levels.Based on the mentioned DoE,samples in the form of dog-bones were printed and different mechanical tests such as tensile, surface quality,density and hardness were carried out and the trend of the results in terms of values and interactions were compared.Results showed that hardness and density had a similar trend when analysing them using different statistical methods such as interactions or mean values.\n\nThe results were characterized based on the rheology of the melting pool and formation of pore structures. Higher laser power and lower scan speed produced higher hardness due to better energy transfer and good melting pool quality.Also,for lower than optimum hatch space values,due to larger overlap,hardness decreased.For higher than an optimum hatch spacing,on account of dispersion of beam energy,the hardness also reduces.Low scan pattern angle produces better hardness due to double remelting of overlap of previous layers. Stress relieving improved the hardness for samples with alower energy density which is related to the formation of less $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ martensite for as-built samples. Increasing the temperature of heat treatment leads to increasing grain size and reduction of hardness.\n\nFuture work will be directed toward analysing process parameters on the value of shrinkage and dimensional deviations.Monitoring the melting pool temperature and characterising it with rheological phenomena would be another direction for upcoming research to explain the temperature profile and find the link with mechanical properties and processparameters.",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM) has seen extensive use in both academia and industry due to the ability to produce complex geometries unattainable by the majority of traditional manufacturing methods and to do so in a single production phase.In particular,metal-based printing techniques such as selective laser melting(SLM) [1] and electron beam melting (EBM) [2] are growing in popularity due to the promise of constructing functional parts for applications in aerospace [3, 4],automotive [5] and medical [6] industries. Despite this promise,application of metal AM parts is hindered by poor surface finish [1],dimensional deviation from the original computer model and differing mechanical properties compared to conventional manufacturing processes.",

    "content": "With respect to SLM, such issues can be traced back to suboptimised build processes, leading to the unstable meltpool formation, unmelted particles,poor particle fusion and ‘volcano’ effects. These can lead to microporosity, cracks, keyholes,residual particles,delamination, distortion and staircase effect, thus negatively impacting a part's mechanical properties [7]. Teng et al. [8] provided a review of defect modelling in laser AM build processes, categorising defects into two primary subgroups of porosity (balling and keyholes)- or crack (residual stress and lack of fusion)-related origins. Gong et al.[9,10] provided a more fundamental understanding of defect formation during the build process and the influence on mechanical properties.They characterised these as mass transfer, vaporisation,melt pool discontinuity and process instability phenomena. More specifically,mass transfer can result from excess in imparted thermal energy from the laser,resulting in a recoil pressure in the melt pool. This in turn leads to uncontrolled ejection of molten material. This material subsequently undergoes rapid solidification leading to the welding of small spherical particles on the upper build surface.If the welded material is larger than the designated build layer thickness, they can be dislodged by the powder recoating blade,leaving behind a small pit in the build layer resulting in a porous region within the bulk of a part.Process instability relates to the inherent system performance and builds precision. For instance,fluctuations in laser power can result in variations in thermal energy impartation beyond predicted expectations. Equally, issues relating to low energy density (low beam power, high scan speed) or unoptimised hatch spacing (beam overlap), can result in a lack of melt pool weting or unmelted powder, resulting in voids and porous regions.",

    "content": " Finally, vaporisation effects result in the creation of gas bubbles which are the precursor mechanism for microvoids and keyhole formations. These issues can be largely attributed to a lack of parameter optimisation and ultimately result in parts with compromised mechanical properties.\n\nTo manipulate the mechanical properties of as-built samples, several methodologies [11] have been used. In the SLM build process of All2Si, changes in hatch strategy and preheating have resulted in variations of part surface morphology and tensile properties. This was attributed to changes in the crack propagation path.Also,preheating of substrate showed improvement in ductility at the expense of strength.Using different hatch styles, preheating and contours allowed for the tailoring of tensile properties [11]. Build direction affects microstructure, mechanical properties and surface quality. The tensile properties in the Z direction (vertical building direction) were found to be lower for higher thermal gradients and cooling rates due to larger occurrences of pores and cracks [12,13].",

    "content": "Heat treatment also changes the mechanical properties of metallic AM parts.For Ti-6Al-4V, thermally induced phase transformation provided the best combination of ductility, strength and hardness. Increasing the holding temperature results in $\\propto$ phase coarsening and decreasing strength. Increasing heat treatment temperature in the range of $\\alpha + \\beta$ leads to increasing the percentage of $\\beta$ and formation of equiaxed microstructure and a significant increase in elongation. In annealing, $\\alpha + \\beta$ precipitation of beta on $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ leads to a decrease in tensile strength and improving ductility[14, 15]. A new investigation [16] of tensile properties of Ti-6Al-4V showed that annealing at $8 0 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ for 6 h results in removing twins and dislocations.Ultimately, it was found that the developed annealing protocol resulted in a fully decomposed lamellar microstructure, leading to a stronger and more ductile build structure with mechanical performance similar to wrought Ti-6Al-4V.

    "content": "SLM of Mg showed both preheating,and layer thickness increased the value of hardness and elastic modulus so that they were similar to human bone [18]. In another study by Yadroitsev et al. 2012,[19] thermal transfer in the solid/ liquid phase was found to be a key factor in solidification and the resulting part mechanical properties for $3 1 6 \\mathrm { L }$ stainless steel.Using lower scan speed and preheating results in the fabrication of coarser structures as these two factors influence the remelted depth. The scan speed controls the track width and height while the effect of preheating is more dominant at $0 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { T _ { m e l t } }$ and inappropriate selection of these parameters may result in Rayleigh instability,balling and track instability, thereby producing samples of lower quality.\n\nWhen considering the build process,the scan parameters dominate several mechanisms affecting build optimisation. Analysing the process parameters on density and defect distribution of Cu-Al-Ni-Mn showed that scan strategy is the dominant factor in pore size and distribution,which relates to heat flow during solidification. Additionally, remelting of the previous solidified layer can be used to eliminate pores and generate more equiaxed grains, which combined improves the relative density [20]. Crack initiation is also related to scanning,where a lack of optimisation of the laser overlap area leads to the formation of cleavage steps along points of tensile loading. The scanning strategy affects the sliding surface from track to track and layer to layer, resulting in changes in tensile properties. Combined optimisation of track to track and layer to layer sliding surfaces result in the generation of excellent tensile strength [21].",

    "content": "Powder morphology also has a profound impact on the SLM build process,where generally smaller powders have been found to yield improved mechanical properties.When using larger powders,micropores were more prevalent in build layers resulting in reductions in tensile strength. It should also be noted that this is interrelated with optimisation of laser power, where reduced thermal penetration within the resulting thicker layers leads to reduced remelting and consolidation, thereby exacerbating inhomogeneity in the build material and increasing the chance of cracks and pores. Cracks generated by this process are generally found to be orientated along the layer axis and so external loads perpendicular to these layers readily cause fracture [22]. Contrary to the goal of increased mechanical properties,Taguchi methods have been applied to control the porosity in such a way as to reduce the elastic modulus from 248 to 120 and 110 to 40 GPa for CoCr and Ti respectively. Interesting in this instance is that the deliberate reduction in elastic modulus can be tailored to match that of human bone, simply by changing process parameters and using lattice structures,yielding many exciting possibilities for biomedical implants [23].\n\nUltimately,a thorough analysis of build process parameters is required to control physical phenomena such as melting, solidification, vaporisation, periodic heating and cooling dynamics,to increase the build efficiency in SLM.Examination of the current literature has revealed that efforts have been focused on single parameter analyses,while many of these deal with the prediction of mechanical properties.Results are therefore not directly expandable and transferable to other machines due to lack of test samples,repetition and real-time analysis [24].",

To enhance the ductility and machinability of the parts, different annealing processes followed by furnace cooling have been used [1, 27]. Table 3 shows the heat treatment conditions that were used in this experiment. Stress relieving leads to removal of the generated thermal stresses due to periodic cooling and heating. Mill annealing is the removal of $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ -martensite to improve ductility. $\\alpha + \\beta$ annealing results in the formation of globular microstructures and therefore better ductility. To further increase the ductility, $\\beta$ annealing is carried out [14].

With respect to numerical modelling and forecasting,ANNs are able to predict/estimate the outputs from complex multi-parameter-based problems,such as those seen in the SLM build process.ANN is a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs to solve problems in a similar way that a human brain would. When outputs are not a linearly separable combination of inputs,multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a fast and accurate application for function approximation [30]. These networks use supervised learning methods called “backpropagation” for network training. The inputs of the ANN were laser power, scan speed,hatch space, laser pattern angle and heat treatment. Qnet 2Ooo software was used for this model which has the ability of modelling and analysing the effective process parameters on the results and is wel-known to model industrial processes [31, 32]. Using an initial prediction, which is then validated using experimental test data, the network begins training in the first steps towards wider system predictive understanding.Following this initial round of prediction, the ANN uses a recall procedure incorporating the new experimental data to determine the validity and accuracy of the network, before commencing on subsequent rounds until predictions match those of experimental outcomes to a high degree of correlation.\n\nTable 2Process parameters and levels   ",

    "content": "# 4.3 Average contribution of input nodes on outputs using ANN\nModelling ofthe SLMbuild process ofTi-6Al-4V is dictated by a strong understanding of melt pool dynamics, which is largely related to thermal control mechanisms.The challenge when processing Ti-6Al-4V is its low intrinsic thermal conductivity, which results in complex melt pool behaviours when compared to materials such as stainless steel [33,34]. To analyse the effective parameters, interrogator analysis using ANN has been carried out.The interrogator analysis has been done five times for all cross validations to show which parameter is more influential on the value of tensile properties.Figure 3 shows the interrogator analyses for all cross-validations. Of all the parameters interrogated, it was found that the laser power had the highest influence on the value of tensile strength. Depending on the selection of the other parameter values,any number of these could be seen to have secondary influence, thus highlighting the challenges of modelling.\n\n# 4.4 Interaction of process parameters on tensile values\nTi-6Al-4V is quite sensitive to internal stresses within the process.However, Ti-6Al-4V has low thermal conductivity and this leads to accumulation of higher heat and lower “lack of melting” problems compared with stainless steel and also has a more complex behaviour regarding microstructure and mechanical properties [33].\n\nTherefore,to derive trends of complex behaviour in AM, contour plots based on the result of the training process in ANN were drawn and analysed. Pre-process,process and post-process parameters affect the porosity,microstructure and subsequently the tensile properties of printed parts.In this section, the effect of process parameters such as laser power, scan speed,hatch space and pattern angle as well as post-process heat treatment temperature on tensile properties are discussed.",

    "content": "Figure 4a-d show a contour plot for laser power against each of the other interrogated parameters.In this research,laser power was found to be the most influential factor on tensile strength and roughness measurements showed that this parameter is the most effective factor on the quality of the surface, confirming Pupo's investigations [35]. It was ultimately found that by decreasing laser power the tensile strength improved,where for powers lower than $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { W }$ the tensile strength was found to be $> 1 \\mathrm { G P a }$ .There are several potential reasons for this.The surface condition can have a significant effect on mechanical properties such as fatigue and tensile behaviour. This is related to layer-layer effect and generation of pores including microcracks,keyholes,lack of fusion, boiling and volcano effect [36]. Surface quality is ultimately related to melting pool size and energy density. Higher laser energy leads to partial melting over a wider area and overflows at the surface, resulting in increased porosity [37]. This behaviour can be explained by an energy density equation,where it is shown that temperature is a direct function of laser power. Therefore, increases in laser power increase the melt pool recoil pressure, resulting in instabilities that lead to increased porosity. The width of the scanning track is related to laser power and scan speed as well as the interaction of these two parameters.When using higher laser power and lower scan speed (Fig. 4a), the melting pool becomes wider and temperature increases.Beyond a critical point, the centre of the melt pool can exhibit Marangoni's effects, transferring heat towards neighbouring build regions. Consequently,a melt pool region of partial solid and liquid material (mushy region) forms.\n\n![](images/ce59c8c3c215697e81b55b9fb6307b266ea8b3e2736dbe86e78f2ed69fb05033.jpg)  \nFig.2 Results of ANN modelling for each cross-validation",

    "content": "During manufacturing, irregularity of layer tracks was observed for samples fabricated at lower scan speeds, resulting in reduced tensile strength. When the scan speed increased, tensile strength also increased,as can be seen in areas 1 and 2, Fig.4a,and which is in agreement with the literature [41]. It is worth noting that a small reduction on tensile value is observed in Fig. 4a (zone 4),which can be explained by the greater effect of laser power on tensile strength (Fig. 3). The largest tensile strength was obtained at laser powers ranging between 93 and $1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { W } .$ This however decreased rapidly towards the lowest laser power $( 9 0 \\mathrm { W } )$ and is believed to be due to a lack ofpowder fusion, which is exacerbated at higher scan speeds due to the lower energy density. Similarly, Qiu et al.

    "content": "Ultimately, the SLM process is sensitive to energy input values. It was found that insuficient energy density is more influential in governing mechanical properties as compared to the samples with excessive energy input. The lack of energy input fundamentally results in unmelted regions, leading to the generation of pores and cracks and the subsequent reduction of tensile properties [2]. Figure 5 illustrates one such instance discovered in the test samples,where a clear lack of powder fusion has generated a large pore within the bulk of the samples. In addition, when increasing laser power and decreasing scan speed, the temperature of melt pool increases and higher Marangoni's effects and flow were observed. This causes instability in melting pool; therefore, unmelted powders move into the melt pool and more waves are generated and fast cooling rate in laser-based AM, ultimately leading to the formation of defective layer surfaces and decreased tensile strength (Fig. 4a region $\\mathrm { C _ { A } } .$ ） Increasing laser power tends to generate higher temperature on the melting pool. It was reported that in SLM of Ti-6Al4V spherical porosity is related to trapped gas under melting pool during solidification [27]. Therefore,in higher laser power, higher porosity and less strength were observed. In addition, during high-speed scanning, balling is found due to low wettability, reduction in contact between substrate and melt and Rayleigh instability.\n\n![](images/1359f1a6414da9ab7afc7a2af4abe873c455a51ee338065d7def260740329a98.jpg)  \nFig.4Interactionof laser power on other parameters.a Scan speed; bhatch space; c scanning patern angle; dheat treatment",

Examining region 3 ofFig. 4b shows that by increasing hatch space from 65 to $8 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ the value oftensile strength increased by $40 \\%$ .As the overlapping area is a direct function of hatch spacing, higher hatch spacing generates lower overlap,and results in optimal build characteristics.It has been reported that within overlapping regions the value of roughness increases between 5 and 7 times compared to the centre of the track and that lower surface defects between subsequent layers result in higher tensile strength [41]\n\n![](images/18a98550c05a5c9c86965a917c8e00fc24fe4fe4e6efad027ecf85a82a8bca6d.jpg)  \nFig.5 Lack of fusion and big pore in the range of millimetre\n\n![](images/62f0a69cc2e8df9f2fbad5cc2022e1c6d874b5366085e3f8a02cf612555147f5.jpg)  \nFig.6 Scan patterns and exerted forces",

Another reason for increasing tensile strength in higher hatch space is related to powder attachment in the overlap area. Larger overlap tends to increase previously fabricated track to absorb more energy and increase the temperature and generate wider heat affected zone and mush area therefore partially and unmelted particles attached to a solid interface and produce bigger pores [29].",

    "content": "Figures 3 and 4c show that laser power has more impact on strength compared to scanning pattern angle. By increasing scan pattern angle, the value of tensile strength increases. This effect is a well-known consequence of the build process and can be explained by the increases laser scan angle resulting in adjacent build lines being aligned away from the direction of the normal forces imposed during a typical tensile test. Increasing pattern angle leads to decreasing the tangential component of the forces and increases the tensile strength of the samples (Fig. 6). Additionally, it is believed that varying the scanning angle can allow for melt pool thermal control effects,which result in the increased tensile strength, particularly at higher laser powers. This would be due to the longer transition time of the laser allowing greater thermal relaxation ofboth the build layer and surface,at a threshold that results in reduced Marangoni's effects.Interestingly for laser powers of 93-97 W, the reverse trend is observed where tensile strength reduces for increased scan pattern angle and may be due to big pores (which are the results of lack of fusion) leading to nonlinear and unpredictable behaviour.\n\n![](images/be40a57b8f11bdc3d333c3b6d81dec99df1419972e42e032a36e86b93f16739c.jpg)  \nFig.7 Interaction of scan speed on other parameters\n\n![](images/46d214e47baa323195d1327cbdb1759d605874f56f50ffa68dac4619306786b8.jpg)  \nFig.8 Interaction of hatch space and scanning pattern on other parameters",

However, in the optimum range of laser power (between 95 to $1 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ ), the tensile values did not present noticeable change (region 2). Similarly, in region 3, the value of tensile properties is constant by increasing heat treatment temperature. This behaviour demonstrates the greater influence of laser power on tensile strength compared to the effect of heat treatment. Interestingly,it is commonly believed that heat treatment is required for all materials to improve parts strain and clearly this is not be the case for Ti-6Al-4V for laser powers $> 1 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ in this study. In this alloy, the background phase is $\\propto$ with a small amount of $\\beta$ ： $\\propto$ phase is stronger and $\\beta$ is more ductile.

    "content": "Figure $\\mathbf { 7 a - c }$ show contour plot graphs are illustrating the influence of scan speed against hatch spacing, scan pattern and heat treatment on tensile strength.Firstly, considering the combined influence of scan speed and hatch spacing,it was found the governing mechanisms dictating the overall tensile strength can be explained by considering the melt pool thermodynamics,as discussed previously.When considering the scan speed parameter, generally for lower speeds, the movement of fluid in the melt pool is equally slower. Dynamically two processes occur, firstly the fluid moves out from the centre carrying heat, which enhances heat transfer. Secondly, fluid in the outer regions experiences zero velocity, which in turn may result in keyhole defect formation. Simultaneously, due to the Marangoni effect, convection transfers the heat from the bottom of the keyholes to the surface and then outward, generating a larger width and ‘cone-shape’ melt pool that decreases the value of surface roughness.Based on Atthey [44] when Reynold's number is $> 6 0 0$ , the melt pool becomes turbulent and a rough build surface is generated. This tends to increase the porosity and reduce the overall tensile strength. The Reynolds number can readily be calculated from Eq. 4\n\n$$\nR _ { e } = { } ^ { \\rho u _ { m } \\omega } / _ { \\mu }\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is density, $u _ { m }$ is scan speed, $\\omega$ is melting pool width and $\\mu$ is viscosity.By increasing scan speed, the cooling rate increases and viscosity decreases,which in turn decreases the melt pool width. Subsequently, the Reynolds number decreases,resulting in less turbulence within the melt pool, thereby reducing defects.This reduction in the defects results in increased tensile strength,which was observed in region 1 of Fig. 7a.",

Ultimately, it was found that the highest strength was achieved for scan speeds of $7 3 0 { - } 7 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m / m i n }$ .Beyond this,as the scan speed further increased,a linear increase in heat treatment temperatures was required to realise optimal tensile strength. This behaviour can be explained by consideration of the microstructural changes with respect to heat treatment. Firstly, during heat treatment, increases in the holding temperature lead to coarsening of the $\\propto$ -phase and a reduction in strength. In stress relieving $( 6 0 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ and mill annealing $( 7 5 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ , a small fluctuation in the value of tensile strength was observed. When increasing heat treatment temperature in the range of $9 0 0 { - } 1 0 5 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ the percentage of $\\beta$ increases and equiaxed microstructures are formed and precipitation of beta on $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ leads to decreasing tensile strength [15].

This is believed to occur because,at lower hatch spacing, there is greater overlap between subsequent build tracks resulting in the production of microcrack defects,which reduce the part tensile strength. These microcracks occur due to the effect of incomplete homologous wetting and residual stresses produced by large solidification and undercooling of the melt pool. Equally, the tensile strength is reduced when using too large a hatch spacing due to a lower build density and reduced thermal penetration depth,which prevents remelting of the previous layers and results in weaker layer adhesion and build inhomogeneity [22]\n\nFigure 8b shows that for hatch spacing between 65 and $7 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ optimal parts tensile strength is achieved from heat treatment value of approximately $6 5 0 – 7 0 0 \\ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ Beyond this hatch spacing $( > 7 5 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ , the tensile strength is at a maximum for reduced heat treatment temperatures.

As the fabricated SLMTi-6Al-4V has $\\alpha$ martensite, which has high strength,annealing due to heat treatment transfers it to $\\alpha + \\beta$ , increasing the lamellae width, which reduces the tensile strength. It is reported that annealing at 7OO and $8 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ only partially decomposes the $\\alpha$ phase in Ti-6Al-4V, meaning twins and dislocations remain, leading to lower ductility and a small reduction in strength [16].Heat treatment effectively leads to transformation of the metastable martensite in the biphase $\\alpha + \\beta$ matrix, thereby enhancing tensile properties [49]. However, the final $\\alpha + \\beta$ morphology is highly dependent on the heat treatment temperature.When heat treatment has been carried out at temperatures higher than required for phase transformation, the beta phase is retained at grain at the boundary of alpha resulting in reduced tensile strength.

    "content": "# 5 Conclusion\nThis investigation showed how changing the SLM process parameters affect the value of tensile strength when printing Ti6Al-4V. The experiment was guided by an ANN model, which was cross-validated by generated data sets and further approved by similar tests from the literature. The study showed that ANNs have the capability to model nonlinear problems such as process parameters in additive manufacturing.Analysis showed that laser power is the most influential build parameter on the value of tensile strength, followed by scan speed, heat treatment, hatch spacing and the laser pattern angle. The results of interaction diagrams showed that laser power and hatch spacing should be kept at optimal values to generate better tensile strength(756.87 to $1 5 3 7 . 6 7 \\ \\mathrm { M P a }$ ).Equally, itwasdiscovered that the higher the scan speed, the lower the tensile strength. Heat treatment also has a profound effect on tensile properties, where higher heat treatment temperatures result in lower tensile properties. Combining process parameters ultimately revealed nonlinear behaviour on tensile properties.However, this research showed an effective means by which process parameters coupling with heat treatment can improve tensile strength in a cost-effective and practical way in a widely utilised commercial AM system.\n\n# Appendix\n![](images/44e51961222a8a4587211e63c42d0daec20d80b1619c8bdb184d7f8e26c89ebd.jpg)  \nFig.10 Stress strain curves for test samples 1,2,6,7 and 10\n\nPublisher's Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",

    "content": "Process optimization of Laser-Based Additive Manufacturing (LBAM) systems is often complicated by the tradeoff between different mechanical properties as well as the relative density window.For instance,parts with similar relative densities can have noticeably diferent tensile mechanical properties (e.g.,elongation-to-failure, yield strength,ultimate tensile strength,Young's modulus).This phenomenoncanbe attributed to the variation of size and distribution of fabrication-induced voids within the final parts.To overcome the aforementioned challenge,we applied an efcient sequential multi-objective processoptimization framework to optimize the quality of LBAM-fabricated parts with respect to multiple non-correlated mechanical properties within the optimal relative density regime.The applied Multi-objective Accelerated Process Optimization (m-APO) method indirectly accounts for the effctof sizeand distributionof voids on the final parts'mechanical properties.The m-APO decomposes the master multi-objective optimization problem into a sequence of single-objective subproblems constructed from mathematically convex combination of individual unknown objective functions.At each step,the m-APO smartly maps the experimental data from previous sub-problems to the remaining subproblems.Therefore,the information captured from previous sub-problems is leveraged to accelerate the master multi-objective process optimization problem.The m-APO exhibited capability to achieve a set of process parameter setups,resulting in the best trade-of between conflicting mechanical properties in the optimal window.The m-APO methodology is employed to maximize relative density and elongation-to-failureof Ti-6Al$4 \\mathrm { V }$ parts fabricated by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) system.The results show that the m-APO achieved the optimal process parameter setups while reducing the time-and cost-intensive experiments by $5 1 . 8 \\%$ ,compared with an extended full factorial design of experiments plan.",

    "content": "# 1.1. Objective and hypothesis\nThe objective of the present work is to apply a novel framework for efficiently optimizing multiple mechanical properties of metal parts fabricated by Laser-Based Additive Manufacturing (LBAM) systems. Inferior mechanical properties of parts fabricated by LBAM hamper the widespread adoption of this technology and accordingly achieving its full potential for fabricating functional parts in different industries.It is traditionally believed that improving the relative density of LBAMfabricated parts will result in superior mechanical properties.However, ourinitial experimental study reveals that obtaining a high relative density for the LBAM-fabricated parts (compared to the traditional counterpart) does not necessarily result in acceptable tensile mechanical properties,such as elongation-to-failure.This phenomenon can be attributed to the existence of different size and distribution of fabrication-induced voids in the final part. The goal of the present work is to employ an efficient multi-objective process optimization framework to optimize quality of LBAM parts with respect to multiple properties such as relative density and elongation-to-failure.The central hypothesis is that breaking down the master multi-objective problem into an intelligently-defined sequence of scalar combination of objective functions,as a set of sub-problems,can optimize conflicting mechanical properties with the fewest experimental runs.The hypothesis is tested against experimental data on Ti-6Al-4V parts fabricated by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) system.This work leads to a generic multi-objective process optimization framework that can be applied to any LBAM system, with any material, for optimizing any scalar mechanical property.\n\n![](images/025cfc7a3cb87f0fa14164c77ea710aa8bb3a05a9bb306410b5c2b7ecd02e9aa.jpg)  \nFig..ematiciatigobstrbtioofodfoplesiilasultieettsilet",

    "content": "Titanium alloys,among them Ti-6Al-4V,show superior mechanical properties such as high strength,high strength-to-weight ratio,high toughness,ductility,biocompatibility,and high resistance to severe environments.Due to these superior properties these alloys have been employed for several applications in various industries.For instance, titanium alloys,such as Ti-6Al-4V,have been used in biomedical applications since they fulfill the requirements,namely high specific strength, good corrosion and fatigue resistance [1-4]. Moreover,opencell structures of highly porous metals are recognized very advantageous in orthopedic implants,due to the low modulus of elasticity (adjustable to that of bone) and high volumetric porosity (i.e.low relative density) [5,6]. In the dental prostheses applications,Ti-Ag and TiCu alloys are used—owing to their relatively high strength—in fabricating partial dentures,clasps and bridges [7,8].Furthermore,titanium alloys are vastly employed in the aerospace industry because of the desired weight-saving property resulted from their high strength-toweight ratio [9-l1].In addition,in the automotive industry,where light-weight materials with an acceptable relative density and strength are required, titanium alloys are favorable candidate materials [12,13].\n\nFabrication of Ti-6Al-4V coupons and parts using Laser-Based Additive Manufacturing (LBAM) techniques has rapidly grown in the past decade,due to their popularity for different applications.One of the main challenges of manufacturing AM metallic alloys is to obtain similar,or even higher,mechanical properties than the conventional alloy.To achieve this,a set of appropriate process parameters,such as laser power,scanning speed,hatch spacing,etc.,should be employed during LBAM [14,15].Therefore,the problem of optimizing process parameters to obtain acceptable mechanical properties,compared to the traditional counterparts,has been addressed by several researchers [14-17].",

    "content": "Due to nature of fabrication in LBAM,the manufactured parts are highly prone to formation of microstructural defects,such as voids and pores,which results in lower relative density of the material,as well as significantly reduced mechanical strength [16,18]. For LBAM applications,it is generally believed that maximizing the part density results in the optimal level of mechanical properties (such as elongation-tofailure),which is typically true.Hence,a data-driven methodology using Bayesian theorem was developed to optimize a single mechanical property—such as part's relative density—called Accelerated Process Optimization (APO)[15]. The APO technique resulted in an average relative density of $9 9 . 2 \\%$ forstainless steel parts fabricated by Selective LaserMelting (SLM) after only five experiments [15].Nevertheless, further experimental studies revealed that maximizing the relative density of the part,although necessary,might not be sufficient to achieve acceptable mechanical properties.We demonstrate the insufficiency of considering high relative density of the LBAM product as the only optimization objective bya few examples.For instance,fatigue resistance of specimens fabricated using LBAM techniques,even with very high relative densities,have been reported to be much lower than that for specimens from conventional methods [19,2O].This lower fatigue behavior was attributed to the planar,low-volume voids in the parts that do not affect the density but significantly influence the fatigue resistance [19].\n\nSeveral factors can potentially cause lower mechanical properties, while having improved relative density,and high cooling rate associated with LBAM is one of them [16,18].For instance in SLM,high cooling rate can cause low ductility in the final part for metallic powders [21].Although the high cooling rate during most LBAM processes results in high yield strength,it causes low elongation-to-failure [22].",

    "content": "The shape and distribution of the pores is another significant factor causing the aforementioned conflicting behavior amongst different mechanical properties [19].For instance,different parts with almost the same relative density can have different pore distribution. This phenomenon is schematically illustrated by Fig.1. In Fig.1,each gray dot represents a void with the same shape and volume.Although all the five parts have hypothetically same relative density (because of similar number of voids),distribution of the voids changes from one to another. For instance,the part (a) has a very congested distribution of voids at the middle of the gauge section of the part; while the voids are distributed close to the grip ends in part (b).Moreover,in parts (c) and (b) voids are formed very close to the surface of the specimen at the gauge section with different patterns,while those are almost evenly distributed inside the specimens shown in part (e).Other than the pore distribution,pores'shape can significantly contribute to the final parts' mechanical characteristics,such as tensile properties.In practice, the pores can have very different shapes and volumes.Fig.l(e) represents some microscopic longitudinal pictures of pores within one part. The intent of the presented work is to apply an efficient data-driven experimental plan to achieve the best tradeoff amongst different properties of the final parts,which could indirectly consider the effects of void size and distribution.\n\n![](images/a94f1f85d6a801d8c39f640664f3ab8425e1d2ee95cd884e777e2f6d45667600.jpg)  \nFig.2.(a)Contour plotof part density versus hatch spacingand layerthicknes.

However, the same process parameter setup results in low elongation-to-failure (area in the middle right of Fig.2 (b)).Considering such a coupled variation amongst various mechanical properties,it is extremely challenging to identify the optimal process parameter setup that results in parts with acceptable mechanical properties. Therefore,this work addresses the following challenging research question in LBAM:What experimental plan is required to optimize process parameter setup with respect to multiple mechanical properties of part?",

    "content": "As discussed before and shown on Fig.3, tensile mechanical response of the AM Ti-6Al-4V is highly sensitive to the selected process parameters,including laser power,scanning speed,hatch spacing and layer thickness.This sensitivity is mainly due to differences in size, shape,location and distribution of fabrication-induced vides,pores,and un-melted regions due to lack of fusion.Consequently,an undesirable amount and distribution of voids can result in very low elongation-tofailure as well as a low failure stress.On the other hand,a low void volume fraction and un-melted regions that are distributed uniformly can enable a large elongation-to-failure anda high failure stress.",

    "content": "Traditionally,maximizing the relative densityof theLBAMmaterial was considered as the objective to find the optimized process parameters in a LBAM system [15].However,for the same relative density, size,shape and distribution of the voids can also dominate the mechanical properties of the LBAMmaterial.Therefore,an extra criterion needs to be considered in optimizing the process parameters to obtain superior mechanical properties.The selected additional criterion in optimizing the process parameters,should be an appropriate representative of the material response. While several mechanical properties—such as modulus of elasticity,ultimate stress,etc.—can be selected,when dealing with one material (as the case of Ti-6Al-4V in this study),elongation-to-failure can be an appropriate candidate for the additional optimization objective.Employing elongation-to-failure $( \\varepsilon _ { f } )$ isalso governed by the stress-strain response of the material,where beyond yield point,a wide range of $\\varepsilon _ { f }$ can be associated with an almost constant stress (see the flat region on the longest stress-strain curve on Fig.3).Thus,use of the ultimate stress may not be reasonable since knowing this parameter may not provide enough information about the elongation-to-failure. On the other hand, not only $\\varepsilon _ { f }$ implicitly accounts for the value of the material's ultimate stress,it can also demonstrate the toughness of the material.As a result,elongation-to-failure of the material was selected as the additional constraint for the optimization of process parameters in this study.\n\n![](images/968f05cc396e5cdf481942abd1c33df2a2492b255a7cc61a94a4371871f17a82.jpg)  \nFigelees process parameters.\n\n![](images/602794d6128b9ac4bd8b8cac70c5090ab0780d29a7646e735803607bac2fe420.jpg)  \nig4e window corresponding to the relative density (see the right plot).",

    "content": "Although the conventional belief regarding the existence of positive correlation between relative density and part's mechanical properties is correct in general, it may not necessarily hold in the optimal window corresponding to part relative density. This contradictory phenomenon is depicted by Fig.4.The plot on the right illustrates the data scatter plot of the scaled relative density and the scaled elongation-to-failure for Ti-6Al-4V parts fabricated by SLM (see Section 3.1.2 for details). The slope of line represents the Pearson correlation coefficient $( \\rho )$ between relative density and elongation-to-failure.Although not very significantly,they are positively correlated $\\zeta = 0 . 2 1 8 )$ .However,if we look at the optimal window with respect to relative density (i.e. parts with scaled relative density greater than O.82) we observe a converse phenomenon (The optimal relative density window can be any acceptable relative density depending on the application).The plot on the left illustrates the data scatter plot of the scaled relative density and the scaled elongation-to-failure for parts fabricated within optimal window. It is evident that relative density and elongation-to-failure are negatively correlated $( \\rho = - 0 . 6 4 6 )$ . In other words,under the relative density optimal regime,there is no guarantee that improving the part density give rise to higher elongation-to-failure.With this in mind,our problem falls into the scope of multi-objective optimization. However, the existing multi-objective optimization methodologies are not wellsuited for optimizing LBAM processes with respect to multiple mechanical properties.",

    "content": "The existing multi-objective optimization methodologies fall into two major categories: (i) scalarization methods and (ii) evolutionary algorithms [23,24]. Scalarization methods,which are considered as the classical approach in the literature,aggregate multiple objective functions to reduce the multi-objective problem into a scalar or single-objective optimization problem,enabling the employment of single-objectiveoptimizationtechniques[24,25].Thiscategoryof methodologies is not applicable for the current multi-objective mechanical properties optimization problem in LBAM because the functional form of the objective functions-representing the relationship between process parameters (e.g.,hatch spacing and layer thickness) and quantities of interest (e.g.,part density and elongation-to-failure)- are unknown.Moreover，constructing the surrogate models representing the mathematical form of objective functions requires a large number of very time-and-cost intensive experimental data,which is not economically feasible for LBAM processes.In contrast to the classical scalarization methods,evolutionary algorithms directly generate a set of Pareto optimal solutions—representing permissible tradeoff between contradictory objective responses-in an iterative manner and gradually improve the quality of the Pareto optimal solutions [24,26-29]. This family of algorithms requires numerous objective function evaluations (i.e.,many LBAM experimental runs in the current mechanical properties optimization problem).Hence,we do not apply them to address the current multi-objective process optimization problem since they result in an extremely high experimental cost.There is a serious research gap for optimizing multiple mechanical properties of LBAM fabricated parts in an efcient manner.",

Building orientation is another key factor afecting the part's tensile properties.In most cases,building the parts parallel to the loading direction,in tensile specimens,results in lower tensile strength compared to perpendicularly built specimens [22,3O].Different cooling rates resulted from different building orientation may be the reason for the aforementioned anisotropic behavior [22,30].",

Presence of un-melted regions in the LBAM specimens does not influence the relative density of the part,while resulting in a weak section along the specimen's length and, thus,premature failure of the corresponding specimen.

    "content": "Hyper-Volume $( H V )$ metric—a well-known performance indicatorin the realmof multi-objective optimization—is employed to construct the stopping criteria for m-APO [51,52]. $H V$ assesses the size of the region on the objective space dominated by the resulting Pareto optimal solutions. Therefore,higher $H V$ indicates beter coverageof the true Paretofrontandthus bringabout thebetterPareto frontapproximation.Throughoutthe algorithm, $\\Delta H V$ (i.e., $H V$ increment)represents the contributionofanew Pareto optimal solution in terms of solution improvement.Inother words, $\\Delta H V$ quantifies the achievement of a new Pareto optimal solution.For instance,in Fig.11 black rectangle represents $\\Delta H V$ associated with a new Pareto optimal solution.Moreover,the size of the whole shaded area (including the black rectangle) indicates he $H V$ associated with the current approximated Pareto front.m-APO continues designing experiments for the currnt sub-problem via APO until the current $\\Delta H V$ is less than a prespecified boundary (i.e., $\\Delta H V < \\varepsilon _ { 1 }$ ).In that case,m-APO stops proceeding with the current sub-problem and move on to the next sub-problem.

    "content": "# Abstract\nTi-6Al-4V is commonly used in orthopaedic implants,and fabrication techniques such as Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) are becoming increasingly popular for the net-shape production of such implants,as PBF allows for complex customisation and minimal material wastage. Present research into PBF fabricated Ti-6Al-4V focuses on new design strategies (e.g. designing pores,struts or latices) or mechanical property optimisation through process parameter control-however, it is pertinent to examine the effects of altering PBF process parameters on properties relating to bioactivity. Herein, changes in Ti-6Al-4V microstructure, mechanical properties and surface characteristics were examined as a result of varying PBF process parameters, with a view to understanding how to tune Ti-6Al-4V bio-activity during the fabrication stage itself. The interplay between various PBF laser scan speeds and laser powers influenced Ti-6Al-4V hardness,porosity, roughness and corrosion resistance,in a manner not clearly described by the commonly used volumetric energy density (VED) design variable. Key findings indicate that the relationships between PBF process parameters and ultimate Ti-6Al-4V properties are not straightforward as expected,and that wide ranges of porosity $( 0 . 0 3 \\pm 0 . 0 1 \\%$ to $3 2 . 5 9 \\pm 2 . 7 2 \\%$ and corrosion resistance can be achieved through relatively minor changes in process parameters used-indicating volumetric energy density is apoor predictor of PBF Ti-6Al-4V properties.While variations in electrochemical behaviour with respect to the process parameters used in the PBF fabrication of Ti-6Al-4V have previously been reported,this study presents data regarding important surface characteristics over a large process window, reflecting the full capabilities of current PBF machinery.",

    "content": "Titanium-based alloys, particularly Ti-6Al-4V,are the most commonly used materials for orthopaedic implants, due to properties such as low cytotoxicity and high mechanical strength [1-4].However,in spite of widespread clinical use,challenges remain in the use of Ti-6Al-4V for orthopaedic implants,particularly with respect to implant-bone fixation. Successful orthopaedic implant fixation requires good osseointegration, with osseointegration being defined as the formation of a direct structural and functional connection between living bone and the surface of a load-bearing implant [5-7]. Thus, for permanent fixation,the host bone must be active enough to form a stable chemical bond with the orthopaedic implant surface.Ti-6Al-4V surfaces exhibit low cytotoxicity,but unfortunately are also bio-inert, and so do not interact well with host bone cells; only weak interfacial bonds are formed following implantation, leading to inferior long term fixation [8-11]. Patients with so-calld poor bone stock (bone with low bio-activity) due to pre-existing conditions (e.g. osteoporosis or atypical bone anatomy) often require implants with extra osseo-inductive features such as bone screws or surface patterning to enhance bone formation processes at the implant-bone interface [12-14]. Conventional implant manufacturing processes cannot accommodate the need for supplementary features or patient-specific implants, however,advances in additive manufacturing now allow for the production of previously un-manufacturable complex shapes, structures and features.",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM) methods such as powder bed fusion (PBF)are becoming increasingly attractive for the fabrication of customised implants. PBF can produce highly complex components, the designs of which can be directly modelled from patient data (e.g. Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Computed Tomography scans). PBF fabrication occurs as follows; first the 3D CAD (Computer Aided Design) model is prepared and sliced into 2D layers of specified layer thickness.Within the PBF build chamber,thin layers of pre-alloyed powders are spread onto a build platform,and a high energy laser beam scans over the powder bed following the pattern of the sliced CAD model, at a set speed.The high energy laser beam melts the powder particles,forming a melt pool (also referred to as a scan track, similar to a weld track) which solidifies rapidly ( $< < 0 . 1 s )$ . Once the layer is complete,the build platform is moved down by one layer and recoated with powder. The process is repeated, resulting in the layer-wise production of the component. Commonly used process parameter ranges are tabulated in Table 1.\n\nPBF Ti-6Al-4V implant functionality can be modified at various stages, for example; 1) during the design stage, when features can be added into the 3D models,2) during fabrication,by manipulating the PBF processing parameters, or 3) through various post-processing treatments.At this stage,it is clear that the choice of parameters in the PBF fabrication stage has an enormous influence on final Ti-6Al-4V properties [15,22-28],due to their effect on phase formation. Ti-6Al-4V has an allotropic temperature of approximately $9 9 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ [29-33],with its phase diagram shown in Fig 1.\n\nTable 1.Process parameter ranges commonly used for PBF Ti-6Al-4V [15-21]   ",

    "content": "‘As-built' PBF Ti-6Al-4V components characteristically have complex thermal histories due to the extreme heating, melting and cooling rates intrinsic to the process-which also locally vary based on component geometry. Cooling rates within the PBF melt pool can range between 12000 and $4 0 0 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / \\mathrm { s }$ depending on the amount of energy supplied [34,35],and these extreme cooling rates through the transus temperature produce microstructures composed mainly of fine grained acicular $\\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\nabla } } \\propto \\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\nabla } }$ Ti-6Al-4V [4,35-39]. Additionally, the transfer of heat from the molten zone into the surrounding powder causes dendrite formation. The high energy laser beam, while scanning over each layer, generally penetrates through to previous layers, resulting in each layer undergoing multiple heating and cooling cycles. Therefore, fine microstructural evolution occurs during building due to the transfer of heat from the molten zone into the surrounding powder, with dendrites forming perpendicular to the applied layer, allowing vertical crystal growth through several layers [27]. These columnar $\\beta$ grain structures aligned along the print height can lead to anisotropy particularly with respect to tensile strength [40].",

    "content": "Previous work in the field includes that of Pattanayak et al [47],and Sallica-Leva et al [48] examining the PBF fabrication of Ti-6Al-4V using EOS M270 machines.Pattanayak et al examined the interplay of laser scan speed,and hatching pattern,and showed that fully dense thin plates could be obtained when maintaining a laser power to laser scan speed ratio of above 0.5, with a hatch spacing smaller than the laser diameter [47], while Sallica-Leva et al examined the relationship between energy input and porosity and determined that three main porosity levels can be produced, which are produced with changes in energy input [48]. This is in agrement with the work of Qiu et al (Concept Laser M2 Cusing), Song et al and Thijs et al. [46,49,50]. However, it should be noted that the work of Song et al and Thijs et al examine PBF Ti-6Al-4V produced with in-house constructed PBF machinery. Porosity in SLM Ti-6Al-4V has been shown to negatively afect fatigue strength (specifically micron sized pores) [35,37,51], while residual stresses have been shown to affect fatigue crack growth [33]. Shunmugavel et al further showed that the fracture mode of PBF (SLM $1 2 5 ^ { \\mathrm { H L } }$ Ti-6Al-4V is transgranular due to low ductility [52]. The work of Chen et al (EOS M280, the same machinery as used in this work) indicates that apart from the process parameters,build location/direction also affect PBF Ti-6Al-4V properties [53]. Their investigations showed that while Young's moduli did not vary across the planes, the hardness of the $\\mathbf { X }$ -plane (perpendicular to the build plate as well as the scanning directions) was approximately $2 0 \\%$ lower than that of the other planes,and showed reduced corrosion resistance due to high porosity, supporting the work of Murr et al [2].",

    "content": "Porosity was determined using optical microscopy, rather than porosimetry techniques, due to the nature of the porosity expected; the non-connected (and stochastic) pores are likely to contain unmelted or partially melted particles,as there is no scope for particle removal during or following the formation of these pores. The agglomeration of particles within these pores affects the measurement of density and porosity through displacement techniques or porosimetry respectively,and thus porosity was determined through optical analyses. All samples were sonicated for 3 minutes in ethanol, dried with compressed air,and imaged using an Olympus GX51 optical microscope at 5x magnification. Image analysis (to determine $\\%$ porosity and average pore area) was carried out using ImageJ (vl.5Ob),an image analysis software created by Wayne Rasband of the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda,MD, USA)-this software is commonly used in biomaterials research. Each image was opened in ImageJ, split according to colour channel, then manually thresholded.The ‘Analyse Particles' feature of ImageJ was then used to count and size the pores (in terms of 2D area), with a minimum pore area set as $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } .$ ,and a minimum circularity set as O.5 (i.e. more than $5 0 \\%$ circular). Three images (and measurements) were taken for each category, with re-grinding and polishing steps following each measurement. Sample hardness was measured using a Wilson Rockwell hardness tester. A $1 2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ diamond spheroconical indenter (C Rockwell scale) was used with a load of $1 5 0 \\mathrm { k g }$ . 10 measurements were made for each category.",

    "content": "The uppermost layers of all of the stress relieved, unpolished surfaces were covered in partially melted particles,as seen in Fig 2. As previously mentioned, the outer layers of PBF Ti6Al-4V experience different cooling rates to the bulk, due to fewer re-melting/re-cooling cycles caused by laser penetration. Heat energy dissipates readily into the surrounding powder, leaving partly melted/fused particles across the layers. Notably, more partly fused particles were observed along the z-plane edges of PBF Ti-6Al-4V,as compared to the XY topmost layer (parallel to the build plate).The amount of partially fused particles on the outer layers are also influenced by powder splash caused by the laser beam diameter (spot size) and hatch spacing used. The samples produced with low VED $( < 5 0 \\mathrm { ~ J / m m } ^ { 3 } )$ had comparatively fewer partially melted particles across their $\\mathrm { { x } / \\mathrm { { y } } }$ surfaces than those produced with higher VED $\\mathrm { ( > 5 5 J / m m } ^ { 3 } \\mathrm { ) }$ likely due to comparatively exaggerated cooling rates/heat transfer between the final layer and the surrounding powder caused by the higher thermal energy supplied per unit volume. The production of rough outer surfaces is near unavoidable with PBF,and thus these outermost layers are generally removed prior to usage. As-built surface roughness, however, is important to consider with respect to the future reduction of post-processing treatments.\n\nFollowing the grinding back and polishing of the uppermost XY layer of the samples, distinct variations in surface appearances could be observed even without etching. Black dots were seen on the majority of sample surfaces produced by each process parameter combination,as seen in Fig 3, indicating the presence of pores formed through either gas entrapment or accumulated layer-wise defects produced during fabrication.",

However,all of these studies were conducted in simple solutions such as NaCl or Ringer's solution,and thus fail to incorporate the effects of other compounds found in human body fluids such as amino acids and vitamins.",

Within the moving melt pool, both surface tension and temperature gradients form, resulting in thermo-capillary convection flow (the Marangoni effect). Balling and partially melted particles can affect subsequent layer deposition and adherence. When subsequent layers are melted onto previous layers,there is potential for partially melted particles to be re-melted due to the multiple layer penetration of the laser,however,as the bulk forms,a random distribution of partially melted particles and pores will form throughout the build height. Once the track has solidified, small wavelike ripples are apparent on the weld tracks [73],as well as partially melted particles. Therefore,surface topographies and indeed porosity are unavoidable without the careful choice of processing parameters to maintain the dynamic equilibrium of the melt pool. This is shown schematically in Fig 10.Laser power and laser scan speed have the greatest effect on the melt pool, with increases in scan speed causing the size of the melt pool to increase, while increasing scan speed elongates/narrows and lowers the temperature of the melt pool [23]. Increasing the overal VED is linked to comparatively more gradual cooling rates.",

    "content": "Corrosion resistance must also be considered if choosing to increase surface roughness or porosity. Ti-6Al-4V normally exhibits high corrosion resistance due to its spontaneously formed passive oxides able to withstand the local bodily environment (i.e. joint fluid). PBF Ti6Al-4V will necessarily behave differently to wrought Ti-6Al-4V,due to but not limited to the peculiarities of the melt pool and rapid solidification related solute segregation. As-built PBF Ti-6Al-4V is composed of majority $\\alpha ^ { \\ast }$ phase,which is reported by some groups to be less resistant to corrosion [68]. Following stress relieving procedures, the decomposition of the metastable $\\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\nabla } } \\propto \\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\nabla } }$ phase into lower energy $\\alpha + \\beta$ phases, the corrosion behaviour of PBF Ti-6Al-4V has been reported to more closely match that of wrought Ti-6Al-4V [80].

However,bulk microstructure affects surface oxide formation. Some groups have reported that the solute partitioning between $\\alpha$ （204 and $\\beta$ phases in Ti-6Al-4V (Al segregates to the $\\propto$ phase while $\\mathrm { V }$ segregates to the $\\beta$ phase) affects surface oxide formation, with vanadium oxide dissolution in the biphasic oxide film leading to cation vacancy generation and thus weakening of the film [81,84]. The interfacial regions between the phases (both bulk and surface) are also reported to be more susceptible to corrosion [85]. Thus,it is not clear which of the $\\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\nabla } } \\propto \\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\nabla } }$ or mixed $\\alpha \\mathrm { + } \\beta$ phases are more desirable in terms of corrosion resistance.",

Despite this,VED is often used in the pre-fabrication stage to predict and differentiate the final properties of PBF Ti-6Al4V produced with differing process parameters. It is more pertinent to choose individual PBF process parameters with an understanding of how these process parameters work together to produce the final Ti-6Al-4V product.Moreover, VED as it stands describes the immediate environment of the moving laser,and so is a layer-wise descriptor at best. It is important to reduce the dependence on VED as a design variable for PBF Ti-6Al-4V.\n\nThis study was not without limitations,in large part due to the examination of top, or x-y, surfaces only.Future work should focus on curved surfaces and cross-sections for improved microstructural analysis.",

The properties of the shell,or outer layers, of the implant are the most important as they directly impact osseointegration and thus the achievement of successful long-term implant fixation.",

    "content": "· Each of the other process parameter combinations produced samples with one or more improved properties when compared to wrought Ti-6Al-4V,and so it is clear that sample properties can be tuned through careful manipulation of the PBF process parameters, leading to potential reductions in fabrication costs (energy) and lead time,as seen in Table 5. · Changes in laser scan speed and laser power affect melt pool formation; the dynamic equilibrium of the melt pool is affected by surface tension and thermo-capillary convection flow. Increasing laser scan speed produces elongated melt pools with increased Plateau-Rayleigh instabilities,and higher likelihood of baling. Increasing laser power deepens the melt pool and increases the number of remelting/recooling cycles experienced by each layer. Laser scan speed and laser power must be balanced to ensure full powder consolidation. · The combination of high laser scan speed $\\mathrm { \\zeta > 1 0 0 0 m m / s }$ ）with low laser power ( $\\phantom { - } < 1 2 0 \\phantom { - } \\mathsf { W } )$ in the PBF fabrication of Ti-6Al-4V leads to poor powder consolidation due to the insufficient supply of thermal energy per unit volume. This results in porosity levels of above $1 5 \\%$ ,high roughness,low hardness and increased susceptibility to corrosion. · The PBF fabrication of Ti-6Al-4V with low laser scan speed ( $\\leq 2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s } ,$ and high laser power $( > 1 0 0 \\mathrm { W } )$ results in the supply of excessive thermal energy per unit volume,and more specifically, increases in layer wise laser penetration depth and keyholing. · The combination of intermediate laser power and laser scan speed produces the most homogeneous PBF Ti-6Al-4V surfaces, with low amounts of evenly distributed pores,low roughness and hardness/corrosion resistance similar to conventionally produced Ti-6Al-4V.",

    "content": "Presently, there is little consensus in the biomedical community on the optimal porosity/ roughness for osseointegration [74-76]; however once osseointegration is better understood, the results of this study can be used to choose PBF process parameters to produce Ti-6Al-4V implants with the required properties. For example,if osseointegration with Ti-6Al-4V implants is definitively found to be enhanced when surfaces have a minimum $\\mathrm { R _ { a } }$ of $0 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and maximum porosity of $0 . 7 \\%$ ,then it is clear that a laser scan speed of $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s }$ and laser power of $2 8 0 \\mathrm { W }$ could be used.\n\nThe present study examined the effects of altering laser scan speed and laser power on PBF Ti-6Al-4V,and provides a map of the PBF process with respect to achievable properties relevant to biomedical applications. The most consistent properties are observed in samples built with ‘balanced'laser scan speed and laser power,i.e.MODS 9 (120 W, $5 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ ，11（ $( 8 0 \\mathrm { W } _ { : }$ $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ ),16 (200 W, $5 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ ),20 (120W, $1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s ,$ )and EOS DEF (280 W, $1 2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } /$ s). These parameters however are not the only ones which affect final component propertiesother important PBF process parameters include spot size, scan strategy, particle characteristics, and temperature uniformity, as wellas second order factors include defocussing distance, gas shielding and time between passes [86]. Studies investigating the interplay of these additional PBF process parameters are required to build on the relationships observed in the current study.",

    "content": "# ABSTRACT\nIn this research, the efects of Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process parameters comprising laser power， scan speed, hatch space and scan pattern angle on the formation of porosity and subsequently density have been analysed. To improve the mechanical properties, post-processes (heat treatment) must be performed. Therefore, heat treatment was added to the design of experiment to analyse the effect of this process coupling with SLM process parameters on the value of density.A comprehensive design set with five levels for each parameter was selected so Taguchi L25 was used as the design of experiment. The significance of each parameter on obtained results was examined using statistical analysis (F-Test) and numerical model (interrogator analysis). The correlation between two process parameters was discussed by using 3D analytical and contour plots and the mechanisms behind these were discussed in depth. The contribution of this paper is a deep investigation of the relation of process parameters and heat treatment on density based on the Artificial Neural Network model. Results showed that better density is obtained with lower scan speed, laser power and scanning pattern angle. Meanwhile, for heat treatment and hatch space, the best density was obtained in their optimum range.\n\nARTICLE HISTORY Received 26 April 2019 Accepted 28 April 2019\n\n# KEYWORDS\nAdditive manufacturing; density; mechanical properties; Modeling; process parameters",

    "content": "Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is one of the most common techniques of metal additive manufacturing (AM).This method has been successfully applied to a wide range of metals including steels, titanium alloys, aluminium alloys and nickel-based alloys with high flexibility in dimension and shape of the products.In particular，Ti-6Al-4V alloy has been extensively used and practiced by the SLM technique for different applications (Gibson, Kvan,and Wai Ming 2002; Gibson, Rosen,and Stucker 2015; Yadroitsev and Yadroitsava 2015; Khorasani, Gibson, Asadnia et al. 2018; Sillars et al. 2018). Like other manufacturing techniques， the desire is to achieve optimum properties of the manufactured part through the correct adjustment of the processing parameters.\n\nAlthough SLM is highly capable of manufacturing materials with high relative density，printing material without any porosity at all still is a challenge. Formation of the pores during the SLM process seems to be highly dependent on the flow of the melt, melting pool and its solidification rate (Qiu et al.2015; Du Plessis et al.2018) so the processing parameters that affect the size, depth and temperature of the melting pool are the key elements in controlling porosity.",

    "content": "It has been reported that for any specific power, the variation range of scan speed is limited due to balling effect (Averyanova，Bertrand,and Verquin 2011；Qiu et al.2015).Unsuitable selection of laser power and scan speed causes instability of the melt flow that results in the formation of pores.It is believed that Marangoni convection and recoil pressure are the root causes of the instability of melt flow and pool (Khorasani, Gibson,and Ghaderi 2018). Investigating the influence of a wide range of processing parameters on the formation of pores,relative density and mechanical properties of SLM Ti-6Al-4 V alloy showed that mechanical properties are highly dependent on the printing orientation (Simonell, Tse,and Tuck 2014; Sutton et al. 2017). Teng et al. (2017） investigated porosity and cracking related defects as well as lack of fusion. The temperature gradient causes some metal to convert into the vapour state, which is trapped and forms a bubble, also known as a keyhole. One study showed that the keyhole defects are highly dependent on the speed of the laser and emphasizes that higher scan speeds reduce keyhole defects. This is related to the reduction of energy density and subsequently melting pool temperature, which are the source of vapor and keyhole (Teng et al. 2017).",

    "content": "Analysis of microstructure，layer-by-layer，showed major anisotropy of Young's modulus and modest anisotropy of other mechanical properties (Jhabvala et al.2010; Dadbakhsh, Hao,and Sewell 2012; Long et al.2018). This can be related to the irregular orientation of the grains in different directions.Part layout directly affects the main variables， which are temperature distribution and cooling rate.These two factors,along with the gas flow, greatly affect the occurrence of defects such as porosity in SLM parts.Delamination is directly proportional to temperature distribution and gas flow. To reduce the chance of delamination, the temperature distribution should be kept relatively constant. It was observed that there is a stronger bond and fewer pores between layers when the gas flow is perpendicular compared to when the gas flow is parallel to the part. However, this is highly related to the shape of the sample.\n\nLaser scanning speed and preheating temperature both have a significant effect on the depth of the melting pool.Preheating affects the height of the melt pool whereas scanning speed controls the width of the track.The preheating controls the contact angle and depth of the melt pool because adhesion between solid and molten metal is the cohesive force causing molten metal to spread out and forms the pores (Yadroitsev et al. 2013).",

    "content": "The density of powder metal with three different particle sizes was studied by Spierings, Herres,and Levy (2011). Finer particles can be melted quickly,resulting in higher density. On the other hand, larger particles have a benefit of a greater breaking elongation,which is equivalent to the conventionally processed material. The scan velocity is typically determined according to the particle size distribution since it requires higher scan speed to melt the finer powder and slower speed to melt coarser particles. However, if the particle size is coarse without finer particles filling the gaps， the overall density of the part decreases and the surface roughness will increase.\n\nTo minimize the occurrence of porosity, the process parameters such as laser power，scan speed，hatch space,etc.are required to be optimized based on the geometry of the part,mechanical properties and chemical composition of the material.Moreover, the process parameters should be selected in proportion to each other.\n\nLack of comprehensive investigation on density was found in the literature that ties process parameters to density by discussing the rheology of the melting pool. Most of the literature revolved around small data sets which suffer from Gaussian errors and therefore an extensive study is needed to show the relationship between process parameters and the density of printed parts.",

The effect of heat treatment coupled with process parameters produced interesting results,which are statistically explained.

Layer thickness was selected as $3 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } _ { i }$ ,min wall thickness $1 2 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and operationalbeam focus was $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$\n\nTable 1 shows the SLM parameters and specifications.\n\n# 2.2. Design of experiment\nIn the case of the fullfactorial DoE, the total test number is impossible to be performed in terms of cost and time. To reduce the test number, Taguchi DoE was used. Taguchi L25 DoE was used containing five factors and fivelevelsforeach. To analyzeeachfactor independently，an orthogonal array was chosen,and Table 1 shows the factors and levels.\n\nTable 1.

    "content": "During SLM, large thermal gradients，associated with cooling and heating processes, lead to the accumulation of residual stress and generation of $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ martensitic and the results are lower ductility and higher tensile strength. To enhance mechanical properties and machinability, annealing is recommended (Yasa et al.2010;Khorasani et al.2016; Khorasani, Gibson, Goldberg, Littlefair 2017). Table 2 shows the heat treatment conditions that were used in this experiment.The heating and resident time were each fixed at two hours,with the heating gradient gradually increasing from ambient to the set temperature at $4 . 8 \\mathrm { - } 8 . 6 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C / \\mathrm { m i n } }$ .To remove the cooling effect, the cooling rate was kept fixed at $5 ^ { \\circ } C / \\mathsf { m i n }$ across all samples (Welsch, Boyer,and Collings 1993).\n\n# 2.4.Density measurement\nTo measure the value of density,we used electronic Archimedes densimeter SD-200L with density resolution of $0 . 0 0 0 1 ~ { \\mathfrak { g } } / { \\mathsf { c m } } ^ { 3 }$ with solid volume and specific gravity of solid and liquid measurement in one unit.

    "content": "Density is related to the overall quality of the printed parts.In other words,any problem within the process leads to the generation of defects such as trapped gas, unstable melting pool, lack of fusion,volcano effect, cracks,balling,etc.These defects,in general,are called porosity and affect density. Therefore，analyzing the process parameters for density can be helpful to characterize the SLM process and finding the optimum process window.The results were obtained according to our previous research into the relation of density， hardness, tensile strength and surface quality of as-built parts (Khorasani et al. 2019).\n\nTo identify the effect of each process parameter on the value of density, interrogator analysis was carried out.In order to serve this need,Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was implemented on the results. Also,ANN,which is normally used for modelling, was utilized to show the interrogator analysis. Qnet software with the capability of showing the effect of each input (process parameters) on outputs (Relative Density) was used (Vanloocke 1995).\n\nIn interrogator analysis,first，an ANN should be designed, trained and tested.Therefore，according to the condition of our test,a network with two hidden layers $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 1$ was selected. Figure 2 shows the outputs of the network in both train and test,which proves that the accuracy of the designed network is in an acceptable range. The chosen number of samples in train, test and recall/validation were 15,5 and 5 respectively with $4 \\times { { 1 0 } ^ { 6 } }$ iterations. Analytical results and graphs were used to verify the proposed ANN model (Khorasani et al. 2019).\n\n![](images/eb6ea000a7d3ad1f0a352ec4789977f4ccee53b979cdfbcc3b7e2c6a9a16ef2e.jpg)  \nFigure 2.Predictions resultsof designed network (The number ofsamples fortrain,testandrecallwere15,5and5respectively)",

Also, MANOvA shows that of all the parameters interrogated, heat treatment had the highest influence on the value of density. Some other parameters could also be seen to influence density, thus highlighting the challenges of modelling. Analyzing F-tests in Figure 3 (B) shows that the difference in variance for heat treatment is significant,which confirms the ANN interrogator analysis is correct.The secondary influential factors were seen to be hatch space and scan speed,which showed similar impact in both F-Test and interrogator. Finally, laser power and scan pattern angle were found to be the least influential on the value of density.The comprehensive parametric mapping of relative density in SLMed Ti alloy based on the experiment and proposed model is shown in the Appendix.",

    "content": "The results are low wettability and a higher chance of balling，which is known to be a common defect in metal AM and increases pores and reduces density (Tian et al. 2017; Khorasani, Gibson,and Ghaderi 2018). Figure 4(A) shows that with lower laser power, less density is obtained. However, this figure has some fluctuations,which in turn causes fluctuations in density. Figure 5(A) is more linear in terms of variations and shows that increasing laser power improves density. Laser power and scan speed play important roles in energy density and in some areas of this diagram by increasing both factors the energy density reduces. Therefore，due to lack of fusion, lower density was obtained. Figure 4(C) and (D) have less fluctuations due to the lower effect of scanning pattern angle and absence of heat treatment below $6 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C } .$\n\nWhen using lower laser power according to Equation (1), less energy is transferred to the samples and the melting pool temperature decreases. The results are big pores that are often called lack of fusion (Figure 6), and density decreases (Kok et al. 2015; Calignano 2018). Figure 5(A) proved that the scan speed is more influential on the density.\n\nFigures 4 and 5(B) illustrate that with lower laser power, less density was obtained down to $9 5 \\% ,$ which is also explained as a lack of fusion and energy.With hatch space, the density trend is different. Small hatch space starts with lower density associated with high overlap.By increasing hatch space, density improves to an optimum value and then decreases. In the overlap area, the material is mushy and the value of micro-flow motion due to high viscosity is zero.Therefore,no Marangoni's convection is happening and heat penetration increases with the chance of formation of keyholes. Figure 6 shows large pores due to lack of energy density in the bulk of the sample.",

Figures 4 and 5(C) shows that the pattern angle affects the density. Increasing pattern angle leads to decreasing density. The reason is related to higher overlap between subsequent layers. In other words, lower pattern angles experience higher thermal penetration of subsequent layers.More re-melting therefore happens and keyholes that were generated on overlap areas will disappear or become smaller.

These figures show that with heat treatment up to $7 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf C ,$ or without heat treatment, the best density was obtained.This can be related to the formation of $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ due to the high cooling rate (Murr et al. 2009; Khorasani et al.2016; Khorasani, Gibson, Goldberg,and Littlefair 2017;Khorasani, Gibson，and Ghaderi 2018). This phase disappears in mill annealing and stress relieving. Furthermore, due to the lower mass of $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ ，density improves. Over this range,the density shows to have a reduction specifically for temperature above $1 0 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C } .$ ，At this temperature,as shown in Figure 7,micro flow might be occurring on the surface that is associated with temperature concentration and lower mass due to balling and residual particles(Khorasani et al. 2016; Khorasani, Gibson, Goldberg，Masoud Movahedi et al. 2017；Khorasani, Gibson, Goldberg,and Littlefair 2017).\n\n![](images/84a794569b12858cdd4862842dafdb955849e7692e257cd110c85e47031b64b6.jpg)  \nFigure 6.Lack of fusion and formation of a big pore.\n\nSLM is operated under controlled conditions (first vacuum, then argon).

Lack of wettability and energy in this region results in increasing pores and reduction of density to $9 5 \\%$ .Figure 9(A) shows more linear behaviour due to the numerical solution of the ANN method. It illustrates that with lower scan speed and when hatch space increases, density has an initially raising and then decreasing trend.With higher scan speed and increasing hatch space density, there is only a decreasing trend.With the lowest scan speed and hatch spacing the pressure in the droplet, according to Equation (4), increases and due to thermocapillary effect, the surface tension also increases and more bursting happens,which is a fertile ground for porosity in the subsequent layers (Khorasani，Gibson，and Ghaderi 2018).\n\n![](images/0eb3c7b872c21e6354306630ba85ce540181a4670f332c00aeb1f36355586a42.jpg)  \nFigure 7.Surface of samples without heat treatment and local melting zone in $1 0 5 0 ^ { \\circ }$ heat treatment.\n\n$$\nP _ { 1 } = P _ { 0 } - \\ \\gamma \\left( { \\frac { d A } { d V } } \\right)\n$$\n\nWhen increasing hatch space,the energy density is moved to the optimum area and less overlap leads to higher density.

    "content": "Figures 8 and 9(B) show a similar trend for scan speed. Besides that, lower density is seen with bigger pattern angles,which is related to the above-mentioned mechanisms. Analytical observationfrom Figure 8(B) demonstrates that some density peaks occurred in the cases of high scan speed and low pattern angle.This is related to better coverage of overlaps for former layers that leads to more remelting, which generates better density. This effect seems to compensate the lack of wettability in higher scan speeds. Figures 8 and 9(C) illustrate that better density was obtained with heat treatment ranging from $6 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C }$ to $80 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C }$ 、The combination of micro-flow at higher temperature $( > 9 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C } )$ and lack of wetting causes decreasing density.

This figure proves that hatch space is a more influential parameter on density. Another reason for higher density with lower hatch spacing is related to the work of adhesion. In solid-liquid interfaces like melting pool and solidified layer, Young's law leads to Young-Dupre's relation and Equation (5) shows that work adhesion is directly related to surface tension.\n\n$$\nW _ { a } = \\gamma ( 1 + \\cos \\theta )\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle of the tangent to meniscus curve relative to normal line to the surface of the melt pool. Based on Planck's distribution and thermocapillary effect when selecting small hatch space， the surface tension and work adhesion in hatch to hatch decreases and this phenomenon leads to decreasing initial adhesion between solidified layer to melting pool. Furthermore,due to laser pulses, the melt pool becomes unstable and the gradient of fluid flow has non-zero values (Equation (6)):\n\n![](images/2347fa34aa3f68f057096e3aab561b740b32ea82a1b865cfc975f33bc8adf3eb.jpg)  \nFigure 10.Interaction of scan speed versus other parameters (analytical graphs) (Khorasani et al. 2019).\n\n![](images/8398679b2a7515be883bac32432d4e4cc689c9a129e388475b0bb3e459d5e0ce.jpg)  \nFigure 11.Interaction of scan speed versus other parameters (numerical graphs)(RD is Relative density).\n\n$$\n\\nabla u _ { f b } = \\frac { \\partial u _ { f b } } { \\partial x } \\widehat { i } + \\frac { \\partial u _ { f b } } { \\partial y } \\widehat { j } + \\frac { \\partial u _ { f b } } { \\partial z } \\widehat { k } \\neq 0\n$$\n\nWhere $u _ { f b }$ is the speed of fluid.

Higher than a certain amount (region 1 Figure 11(B)) due to a stronger effect of micro-fluid flow, increasing hatch space generates less density (Welsch, Boyer，and Collings 1993; Jovanovic et al. 2006; Sieniawski et al. 2013; Li et al. 2015; Khorasani, Gibson, and Ghaderi 2018). Larger overlap area is obtained in smaller hatch space and it is reported that highly overlapping areas absorb much energy. For less overlap, most of the absorbed heat during heat treatment is spent on the center of the tracks and leads to greater microflow and reduction of density towards $9 5 \\%$\n\nFigures 10 and 11(C) show that heat treatment had the greatest impact on density compared to scan pattern angle.A similar trend is seen when comparing this figure with the interaction of hatch space and pattern angle. However， the area of reduction of density (region 1) is wider compared to Figure 10(C). This is related to the higher contribution of hatch space on density (Figure 4) compared to pattern angle.",

    "content": "In this work, the effect of SLM process parameters including laser power，scan speed,hatch space and scan pattern angle on melting pool, porosity and relative density of Ti-6Al-4V parts was investigated. To improve mechanical properties,heat treatment is necessary for SLM parts.Thus,different heat treatments such as mill annealing,stress relieving，alpha-beta annealing and beta annealing were carried out and the effect of heat treatment on density was also analyzed.The results are summarized as below:\n\n· The most effective parameter on porosity is heat treatment that is confirmed by F-test and interrogator\n\nanalysis.Scan speed and hatch space have almost the same impact on porosity and the lowest impact is related to laser power and pattern angle.   \nDue to low wettability and Rayleigh instability, when increasing scan speed, the porosity increases.   \nWhen using lower laser power, the energy density is smaller and the melting pool temperature decreases. Large pores that are referred to as lack of fusion is a result of this phenomenon.   \nSmaller hatch space generates lower density and is related to higher overlap area and by increasing hatch space density subsequently increases to an optimum value and then decreases from there.This behaviour is related to mushy material in the overlap area and zero gradient of micro-flow motion due to higher viscosity.Therefore, the absence of Marangoni's convection leads to higher temperature and penetration and the chance for the formation of keyholes increases. The area for lower density in the highest hatch space is associated with higher energy dispersion in wider hatch space and less remelting of the subsequent layers.   \nIncreasing scan pattern angle causes decreasing density that is related to lower overlap covered by bigger pattern angles.",

Surfaces of Selective Laser Melting (SLM) products often contain high roughness,which varies in different planes as well.The authors have explored the surface characteristics of the SLMsamples thatare influenced bydiferent combinations of laser processing parameters. The considered procesing parameters were Energy Density (ED) and its technological parameters namely laser power,scanning speed and hatch spacing.Additionally,a comparison study has been executed by rescanning effects considering melting with low ED and,thereafter,rescanning by the best possible laser processing parameters.The results evidently showed that the surface morphologies difer significantly due to different laser processing parameters.Eventually,the thermal and physical behavior of materials,such as the viscosityof the melt pool,thermal and physical stabilityof the melt pool,solidification time,coling time,shrinkage,capillary effect,surface tension,balling effect,andtheamount of melting of a powder particle,influenced the surface properties of the samples,along with unpredictability. The results showed an interesting correlation between the processing parameters and the occurrence of microcracks on the vertical walls of the specimens caused by the partially melted adhered powder particles.",

    "content": "Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is considered as one of the most popular metal additive manufacturing processes to fabricate critically designed aerospace,biomedical and many other engineering parts [1,2].The SLM process has many advantages over the conventional processes,although the main drawback of the SLM process is its poor and inefficient surface finishing [3,4].Surface morphology varies in different planes,and a surface may contain porosity,adhered particles, baling associated glitches,ripple patterns and other defects [5-7]. Along with these,supportive bars and their architectures play a crucial role in surface morphology [8].The presence of porosity,microcrack and layer separation on the surface give rise to mechanical quality impairment [9].Irregular porosity on the surface induces chemical corrosion in the presence of simulated body fluid in biomedical implantation [1O,11].Though surface roughness favors osteointegration in bone implants,most of the other applications need surface finishing by machining or coating[l2].Hence,an intricately shaped part eventually requires further time for completion [13].",

    "content": "The eventuation of several thermodynamic and metallurgical phenomena gives rise to different surface morphologies of an SLM component.As SLM fabrication is a gradual development of tracks and layers by melting,fusion,and the solidification process,several certain and uncertain phenomena occur during the buildup.The noted phenomena are melting quality,viscosity and physical stability of a melt pool,recoil pressure by metallic vapor,re-melting volume from the preceding layer,wetting of layers and tracks,capillary effect,surface tension of the molten metal,melting feature of adhered powder particle,balling effect, thermal stability of a melt pool, inert gas behavior, heat conduction rate, solidification timing，cooling timing and shrinkage process [14-17]. The causes of these phenomena have been noticed by several researchers.They mentioned that these phenomena differ in the density,porosity,microstructure and elemental compositions,which influence the mechanical properties of the products [18-23].Fundamentally, these phenomena can be highly controlled by laser power,scanning speed,hatch spacing,and layer thickness,which are included in Energy Density (ED).Moreover,rescanning of layers can give a significant outcome in the surface buildup [15].",

    "content": "Therefore,it is important to deal with the thermodynamic and metallurgical behaviors, considering the processing parameters, along with their specific contributions in the SLM process to enhance the surface quality of the material. Titanium alloys are regarded as one of the most favorable implant materials for load-bearing applications, due to their lower weight versus strength ratio,high corrosion resistance and biocompatibility [2]. Apart from biological applications,many significant applications of titanium alloys are observed in aerospace and automobile components [22].Hence,the authors have concentrated on the surface characteristics of the Ti-6Al-4 V alloy samples, taking into account different laser fabricating parameters and rescanning strategy.The four-stage study was designed to investigate three sides of the samples i.e., side (vertical),bottom,and top surfaces. All the noticeable observations have been analyzed and interpreted appropriately.",

The values of the parameters were chosen based on several metallurgical properties,such as density,porosity and tensile properties in our parallel researches [24,25].The first stage of the study was based upon the ED,considering different scanning speeds,as listed in Table 1.The second stage of the study was focused on different laser powers,along with the different scanning speeds in its best range,as listed in Table 2. The third stage of the study was considered with different hatch spacing,keeping laser power constant and scanning speed in the best range,as listed in Table 3.The layer thickness was kept constant at $2 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in the entire study.The volumetric ED can be defined by Eq.1 [26],where ED is directly proportional to the laser power $( P )$ and inversely proportional to the scanning speed $( \\nu )$ ,hatch spacing $( h )$ and layer thickness $( H )$ ：\n\n![](images/4aba32013356d0ba69bb2e4e5ce527aada744767edddbca1d8a668960dbf51ad.jpg)  \nFig.1.

    "content": "The adhered and partially melted powder particles influenced the side surface roughness strongly [27]. In the beginning the ED density was low,which caused high viscosity in the melt pool that attracted the adhered powder particles.The adhered particles did not get enough time to melt a high amount of them,due to rapid cooling as the scanning speed was high. On the other hand,high viscosity resulted in poor fluidity and wettability of the melt pool that hindered the liquid from infiltrating the powders [28]. Hence,poor metallurgical bonding occurred between the vertical surface of the sample and the adhered powder particles [29]. Adequate increasing of ED with decreasing scanning speed dropped the melt pool's viscosity in the sample-I-3, that helped the adhered particles enter into the melt pool partially or fully, and melt well along with higher time [3O].With further increasing of ED,the adhered powder particles melted well on and very close to the scanning track.The higher ED induced higher energy with higher time, as the scanning speed was lower.Therefore,more powder particles sintered and adhered to the surface,that caused higher surface roughness.On the other hand,a steep thermal gradient was developed in the melt pool,due to the high ED that caused surface tension gradient and the Marangoni effect.These phenomena discrete the melt pool and favor the balling effect, which was accompanied by surface roughness [27].",

    "content": "High scanning speed caused rapid solidification and cooling of the melt pools,and,as a result,microcracks occurred at the interface of the melt pool and partially melted powder particles.This phenomenon has been discussed in detail in the next subheading.High ED and high thermal gradient caused thermal stress,which elicited microcracks on the surface of sample-I-7,as depicted in Fig.2(b) [9].The bottom surfaces of the SLM samples are made on the supportive bars and a lot of gaps exist between the bars.The gaps are filled up by the powder material,where a melt pool may not get enough support from below [31].Therefore,the melt pool may move downward,as shown in Fig.3(a).On the other hand, the size of the melt pool increased with higherED,and developeda big,pitched ripple surface.The difference in thermal conductivity is high between dense material and the powder bed [3].As the lower side and the next track side of the melt pool are filled with powder particles,the melt pool may bend upwards during solidification,as depicted in Figs.3(a) and (b).",

    "content": "As illustrated in Fig. 3(a),improper adhesion occurs at the time of first layer scanning,due to the presence of the powder bed in the bottom of the melt pool. The powder particles may spatter from the action zone due to high heat-shock during rapid scanning.The molten metal spattered from the action zone due to the explosion of metallic vapor,or an entrapped gaseous bubble.Droplet (small) or splash (big) spattering can occur to reduce the surface tension of the highly viscous melt pool [32]. Therefore,starting samples,such as sample-I-1 and sample-I-2 suffered from droplet and splash spattering due to high scanning speed and low ED.As an example,droplet and splash spattered particles can be observed in the SEM image taken from the top surface,which is shown in Fig.4(d). On the other hand,the samples that were manufactured by high ED and low scanning speed (sample-I-5 to sample-I-7) underwent massive spattering due to the explosion of the melt pools. The mechanism of massive spattering,and a result of it, have been shown in Fig.3 by schematic diagram and SEM image respectively.\n\n![](images/99ef6a6b5a7104819e10a8234fa8a78254c11837ab0d0758d6a546d22856466e.jpg)  \nFig. 2.

    "content": "Moreover,powder particles sometimes move away from the bottom of the keyhole due to the absence of a solid surface below and, thus, the keyhole may collapse during first layer scanning.On the other hand, recoil pressure from the keyhole exerts force on the powder particles at the lower part of it,which causes the lack of materials below the scanning layer.Consequently,these phenomena cause critical defects. The defect at the first layer may provoke the next layers,which leads to bigger pores,as shown in Fig.3(b).The powder particles adhere to the pores by capillary effect and melt partially [7].During cooling,the molten metal shrinks;on the other hand,the partially melted and adhered particle does not shrink significantly,which results in a separation between the melt pool and partially melted adhered powder particle.\n\nHowever,high physical instability of a melt pool in the first layer scanning creates a porous or mounded zone somewhere [16,31]. A tiny part of the bars may remain on the bottom surface of the sample during removing the supportive bars from a sample,which creates an additional rough surface.Therefore,if a surface of a product needs supportive bars and,eventually,if surface finishing by machining is not possible due to complex shape,the bars add roughness.The complex pores,along with trenches and microcracks,initiate cracking under loading [33].As these pores are open,and contain adhered powder particles and a wavy wall; fundamentally,they increase the surface area,which,consequently,decreases corrosion resistance in the chemical environment [10].",

    "content": "A valley and two peaks of the adjacent melt pool together created a big rippled surface at the top of some samples.The waves are big,as the wavy pitches belong to the melt pool with the mean value of the maximum peak-valley length in $2 0 - 5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ as shown in Figs.5 (a)-(c). The motion of the laser beam results in a surface temperature difference between the action zone and the solidifying zone,which also creates surface tension.The surface tension of the liquid surface causes a shear force,and it results in a rippling effect on the top surface of the melt pool [3,13]. Relatively lower ED causes higher melt pool viscosity [17]. Moreover, the higher scanning speed is also one of the causes for the higher cooling rate.Therefore,the molten metal didn't get enough driving forces and time to spread to become flattened. Thus,the phenomenon created a radius of curvature of the top of the melt pool, that results in a big wavy-formed surface at the top of the beginning of the samples as shown in Figs.6 (a) and (b). The viscosity of the melt pool decreased due to the increase in ED,as well as the decreasing scanning speed provided enough time against viscous drags to promote the efficient spreading of the molten material [17].\n\n![](images/e8c53918faa8c91fe3c06f4677016f66f03b54e95b2568044654958d29194a50.jpg)  \nFig4 bubble with thevortex,(c)Anopen-porecreatedbythe gaseous bubbleentrapment,(d)SEMimage ofatopsurface ofasample.\n\n![](images/c1039d2a4e7fa0d129df88ce29fc6bb972db8bc2f903332592d4a4116f3d3360.jpg)  \nFig.5pufceoosdtiofcesaffceiia structure, (c) SEM image of a side view of the top surface,(d) SEM image of a top surface with rippling.",

    "content": "The top surface of sample-I-1 consists of some spattered particles. The viscosity of the molten materials of the sample-I-pool was high due to the low ED,and,thus,the surface tension was high.To reduce the surface tension the materials formed balls,and a serious balling formation occurred.Thus, small droplets and big splash spattered material were produced,which stuck over the top surface of the sample [32]. Relative lowering of scanning speed induces higher ED and,thus,the viscosity is reduced [34].Consequently,the spattered material reduced onto the next samples'top surfaces.Higher scanning speed spattered a higher rate of raw powder particles,which also added a number of spattered particles at the beginning of the samples.A few open pores on the top surface of sample-I-1 and sample-I-2 have been observed, that occurred due to the entrapment of the gaseous bubble. The inert gas mixes with the molten metal from the interparticle space,as shown in Fig.4(a) [22].Then,the bubble moves with the vortex of the melt pool, as shown in Fig.4(b) [22].The bubble may go out of the melt pool, or can stay with the vortex.As the melt pool solidifies from the bottom to the upper part of the melt pool, the vortex also becomes smaller and moves upward [15]. The bubble also moves up with the vortex. Eventually,the bubble may just stay below the top surface having a tiny layer,or remain to be exposed as an open pore,as shown in Fig.4(c). If the viscosity of the melt pool is low, there would be a lesser probability of gaseous bubble entrapment by the melt pool. Thus,the open porosity reduced from sample-I-3 onwards.Eventually,the top surface of sample-I-7,manufactured with the highest ED $2 6 0 \\mathrm { J / m m } ^ { 3 }$ and lowest scanning speed $1 5 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ ,became the smoothest among other samples in the first stage of the study.",

Table 5 shows the approximate numbers of the adhered powder particles per square-millimeter on the vertical surface.The particles have been quantified by counting them using human eyes.It has been observed that the numbers of the particles decreased by almost $5 0 \\ \\%$ from sample-II-1 to sample-II-5,and they are 1,0o0-445 per millimeter respectively.\n\nMicrocrack and separation between the partially-melted powder particles and solidified well-melted material can be observed in the samples (sample-II-1 and sample-II-2) manufactured with high laser powers (95 W and 85 W) along with the high scanning speeds $( 7 6 0 \\mathrm { m m } /$ s and $6 8 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s )$ ). Some gaps,as shown in Fig.7(c),between a partially melted powder particle and well-melted material,can be seen in the sample-II-4, manufactured by $6 5 { \\mathrm W }$ laser power and $5 2 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ scanning speed. These gaps do not belong to microcracks,and probably these will initiate a crack. Sample-I-5 contained well-adhered powder particles without having any separation,crack,or gap.Therefore,the laser power $5 5 \\mathrm { W }$ ,along with scanning speed $4 4 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s }$ ,manufactured the best vertical surface from the roughness and microcrack point of view in the second stage of the study.The bottom surface morphology of the samples is similar,as the samples belong to the first stage,where the surface contains big complex pores,along with adhered powder particles.Sample-II-5 has the lowest defected bottom surface in the second stage.",

    "content": "Though the ED was the same for each sample in the second stage, changes in laser power changed the thermal energy input per short unit time at the action zone.Therefore,a high laser power generated high energy at the action zone and,thus,adhered more powder particles on the side surface by the capillary force and melting them partially [7,35].Lower laser power with slower scanning speed reduced the heataffected zone nearby but melted the material well,with the laser affecting the required melt pool volume for a longer time.The cyclone above the action zone also increased the number of adhered particles. High laser power induced high energy at the action zone that produced a cyclone in the Argon atmosphere.The powder particles were, thus, pulled and assisted to move towards the surface of the melt pool, and adhered to it [36,37].Hence,sample-II-5 got the lowest adhered powder particles,which was manufactured by the lowest laser power, i.e., 55 W.",

    "content": "However,scanning speed played an important role in solidification timing and shrinking of the melt pool [13].The microcrack generation mechanism has been explained with the help of the schematic diagram in Fig.8.High laser power,along with high scanning speed,induced much higher energy on the focal circle compared to the surrounding heat affected zone.This caused lower viscosity in the center and higher viscosityat the periphery side.Thus,a steep thermal gradient had been generated between the center and periphery of the melt pool, that introduced a high Marangoni effect. This effect evolved a tendency in the molten material to flow radially inward of the melt pool [28].This phenomenon assisted a few adhered and partially melted powder particles to get inside of the melt pool which remained there as partially melted particles.Higher scanning speed was responsible for faster cooling.Hence,the melt pool cooled down faster than the partially melted powder particles in it. In this way,the melt pool shrank during solidification,and the entered and partially melted powder particles did not shrink parallelly because of their solidity.Consequently,microcracks occurred in between their interfaces,as illustrated in Figs.8(b) and (c).If observed closely,it can be seen that the cracks happened where the diameter of the powder particle was approximately $2 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ or bigger,and entered or situated in the melt pool by half of its volume or more.In such circumstances,the particle keeps its solidity inside the melt pool,which causes a significant difference in shrinking tension between the particle and the solidifying melt pool.By decreasing the scanning speed and laser power further while keeping the ED constant, the targeted particles got enough energy and time to melt and mix with the melt pool.Eventually,the particles did not create any significant shrinking difference due to the slower scanning speed.",

Most of the cracks happened above or below a powder particle,and horizontally,but not vertically. This happened because a melt pool cools down and solidifies from the bottom to the top [l5].This occurs due to the differentiation of heat transfer rate,where solid material conducts the heat faster than the convection process from the top surface of a melt pool.Thus,the shrinking process occurs from bottom to top.In-between the shrinking process,when the melt at the bottom of a partially melted powder particle solidifies and shrinks,the particle remains as it is,thus,the cracksoccur.Eventually,most of these cracks are below the powder particles,as shown in Fig.9(b),and a few are above it,as shown in Fig. 9(c).",

High scanning speed induces more rapid movement of the gaseous cyclone at the action zone that blows away the power particles [37].It is also well known that the higher laser power induces high laser energy in one place,which causesa higher depth of keyhole and,thus,creates higher collapsing possibilities.Sample-II-5 has the lowest defected bottom surface due to the lowest spattering of powder particles,as the scanning speed was lowest, though the ED was the same.Additionally, there were fewer keyhole collapsing possibilities,due to the lower depth keyhole created by the low laser power and low scanning speed,which decreased porosity [40].",

    "content": "SLM process,as the phenomenon is caused by the complex thermal, physical,and chemical processes,along with several laser interactions [14-17].According to Li etal.[1],low input of energy by high scanning speedand low laser power causes balling formation,due to insufficient melting and wetting with surrounding parts. Low energy produces a high viscous melt pool with high surface tension.To reduce the surface tension, the balling formation starts,and ejects from the melt pool if it is small,as illustrated in Fig.4(a). Otherwise,this remains attached to the melt pool if it is big,as in the SEM image shown in Fig. 14(e).\n\nThe balling mechanism which evolved in this study has been depicted by the schematic diagram in Fig.14.During the first scanning of a layer,only a part of the radiation of the laser is absorbed by the particles at the top surface of the powder layer,and a few of them reflect from the top surface [21].Most of another part laser ray penetrates the powder layer,as illustrated in Fig.14(a).The penetrated laser rays reflect inside the particles and create black bodies [5].The particles absorb the radiation and start melting.As the layers were scanned with low ED $\\left( 3 6 \\mathrm { J / m m ^ { 3 } } \\right)$ ）for first time scanning,the powder particles clustered themselves and made some small balls,with the mixture of molten metal and some solid powder particles.This phenomenon occurs due to the low overall rheological performance of the liquid in aggregation with solid particles [41]. These balls may stay separate by limited liquid formation,or adhere with neck formation between them by sufficient liquid formation [41].This state occurs due to the high viscous formation of the liquid, that acts as the retardation of liquid flow and particle rearrangement. Eventually,the inefficient attachment was acquired between the neighboring balls by the sintering process.",

    "content": "During the second time scanning of the same sintered layer,as drawn in Fig.14(c),a small part of the laser can penetrate the layer due to the sintered material,which created a coverture.From another part of the laser energy,a small portion can be absorbed by the heat exchange mechanism.Hence,most of the heat reflected out from the top surface of the layer by radiation.As a result,the upper part of the layer acquired much higher energy than the lower part of it. Eventually, the layer acquired relatively lower energy than single scanning.Nevertheless,the scanning speed was high ( $\\mathrm { 1 0 0 0 m m } / s$ ）during the second time scanning to fabricate sample-IV-1, that provided low energy into the layer.Consequently,higher sintering occurred,with high viscosity of the melt pool. Therefore,the changes in the side surface are less than in the previous stage of the study.A few balling effects can be observed in this sample.At the top surface of this sample,a lot of droplet spattered particles are present,which were caused by the balling effect and, thus,droplet spattering occurred [3],as shown in Fig.13(a). The balling effect can produce bigger particles,and these particles can't get out from the melt pool due to a higher cohesive force and rapid solidification.The intertrack pores occur due to insufficient mantling and the lack of enough liquid flow against high viscosity and surface tension, which prevents the conjunction between two consecutive tracks. Moreover, some smooth bumpy zone can be observed, that developed by the material stacking.

    "content": "The fluid flow mechanism on the top surface of the melt pool, having different ED due to different combinations of laser power and scanning speed,has been illustrated in Fig.15.High scanning speed with low ED generates a high viscous melt pool [42]. Consequently,a limited surface tension difference occurred on the melt pool surface, that cannot contribute enough driving forces against viscous drags.As a result, the molten material cannot spread efficiently and, thus,a radius of curvature took place on the top surface of the melt pool [3],as shown in Fig.15(a). Hence,this caused a slightly rippled top surface in sampleIV-1 and sample-IV-2.Relatively higher ED and lower scanning speed reduced the viscosity of the melt pool. In this situation,higher surface tension develops in the rear part of the melt pool,while laser energy input departs by moving ahead [42].Consequently,the molten materials float towards the rear part of the melt pool from the center and evolve a stack zone [3],as presented in Fig.15(b),whereas,sample-IV2 and sample-IV-4 contain bumpy structures due to stacking.Though the ED was higher in sample-IV-4 compared to sample-IV-2,the laser power in sample-IV-4 was lower,which resulted in lesser melting and highly reduced viscosity [17]. The pores over the track-lines on the top surface of sample-IV-2 might arise due to collapsing of a small keyhole having high scanning speed and high viscosity [14].If compared to sample-IV-1，which was fabricated by applying a higher scanning speed,it can be said that the ED was not adequate to melt the layer well.",

    "content": "Further lowering scanning speed and rising ED dropped the melt pool's viscosity [17].Thus,the molten material at the top surface of the melt pool got the perfect driving force to be flattened,as shown in Fig.15(c).Moreover, the scanning tracks wetted well with the adjacent tracks,along with their flatness.Accordingly, the top surface of sampleIV-3 became smooth,as shown in Fig.13(c). The top surface of sampleIV-5 had been fabricated near and below the scanning speed of sampleIV-3,and a little lower laser power,along with a litle higher track overlapping.As a result, the surface became almost as smooth as sample-IV-3,along with some staking of materials and droplet spattered particles.",

    "content": "Regressing to the vertical surface morphology of sample-IV-2,it can be noticed that it has many balls,as shown in Fig.l2(b) and Fig.14(e). This was affected by the balling effect caused by the comparatively lower viscosity of the molten material.The lower viscosity occurred due to the relatively lower scanning speed,which induced higher ED.Further lowering of scanning speed caused elevated ED for manufacturing sample-IV-3.At this stage,though the top surface of the layer melted well,the lower part of the layer had insufficient energy to wet the surrounding parts of the action zone.Moreover,the lower part of the melt pool in sample-IV-3 got higher energy compared to sample-IV-2. This molten metal got suficient driving forces against viscous drags, and, thus,created a bigger ball,as shown in Fig.14(d),than the previous scanning shown in Fig.14(a).The small balls had adhered powder particles and,additionally, they adhered by the big ball too.Lowering of scanning speed,along with constant laser power,raised the temperature high at the actioned zone.This caused a high cyclone in the gaseous zone that drove the powder particles to flow onto the melt pool surface and stick on it [37].This incidence increased the adhered powder particles in the vertical surface of sample-IV-3.Eventually, these phenomena create a surface with a complex architecture containing big and small balls,adhered powder particles,and some pores formed by them,as illustrated by the diagram in Fig.14(d) and SEM image in Fig.12(c).\n\n![](images/52bfaf5270a075f0336534b979eb93295f5eb48eb98ad51f0931949810ec114a.jpg)  \nFig4 Miinf with balling effect by rescanning of the layers,(f) A crack on the surface of a ball.",

Raising the laser power at sample-IV-5,dropped the viscosity of the lower part of the melt pool. Consequently,the molten material formed a lesser number of balls.",

    "content": "The research has been carried out in four stages,emphasizing the surface morphologies of Ti-6Al-4V alloy samples using several combinations of different laser processing parameters in the Selective Laser Melting process.The authors have experimented on three surfaces of every sample,respectively,the side surface,bottom surface,and top surface.Influences have been studied of the different energy densities, laser powers,scanning speeds,and hatch spacings.Furthermore,the rescanning process of each layer was performed to observe further plausible variations of surface characteristics.\n\nThe number of adhered powder particles reduced due to the lowering of scanning speed,as well as laser power.A previously unknown phenomenon was observed of microcracks initiated by the partially melted powder particles on the vertical surfaces of the specimens. Evidently,some microcracks in between the partially melted adhered powder particle and the melt pool were noticed on the vertical surface of some samples.They were caused by the difference in the shrinking rate between the solidifying melt and the solid powder particle. Different conditions of rescanning produced a wide range of surface architectures.The physical behaviors of materials during different laser processing parameters have been observed,analyzed and interpreted. Eventually,the viscosity of the melt pool and cooling timing are the key factors in regulating surface morphology.\n\n![](images/b657b4ee21b2a6bef17de7ae657f7f60de39f61a83e185555839a9d51bb5a675.jpg)  \nFig5aoe study, (a) High scanning speed $\\left( 1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s \\right)$ ,(b) Medium scanning speed $( 8 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s )$ ）(c) Low scanning speed( $( 6 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s )$",

    "content": "# ABSTRACT\nSelective laser melting (SLM) is acommonly used powder bed fusion metal additive manufacturing (AM) process.Although SLM is preferred due to its near-net-shape partcommitment,the deposition rate of this proces is slower compared with alternative metal processes.A higher deposition rate of SLMcan be obtained by increasing the laser scanning velocity and laser power;however,this results in decreased part quality due to the SLM process's physical limits.This study presents the conditions for a higher deposition rate for various process parameters with defocused beams to eliminate the void defects due to keyholing formed in the melt pool. Single bead experiments were conducted,and the thresholds of the processparameters resulting in voids were identified.A melt pool depth-to-width ratio of O.85 was found to be a critical value for preventing voids in the process.The melt pool aspect ratio was related with the process parameters by using the normalized enthalpy and the volumetric energy density.The threshold values of the normalized enthalpy due to voids were independent from the beam diameters.Moreover,unstable single bead track thresholds were ploted asa function of the beam diameters.In addition to the experiments,a finite element analysis model was built with calibrated absorptivity and heat source parameters to predict the melt pool geometries for a wide range of process parameters (power $= 1 0 0 – 3 7 0 \\mathrm { W }$ ,velocity $= 2 0 0 { - } 2 0 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ ,and beam diameter $= 1 0 0 { - } 2 6 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ ：",

    "content": "The metal additive manufacturing (AM) market has been growing due to the increase in parts that qualify for end use rather than prototyping in industries such as aerospace, biomedical,automotive,dental, and manufacturing.The powder bed fusion method dominates the AM market because it delivers high accuracy,precision,and mechanical properties of the selected metal alloy.Electron beam melting (EBM) and selective laser melting (SLM) are specific powder bed fusion methods that melt metal powder using electron and laser beams,respectively. Selective laser melting is more common than electron beam melting given the recent technological advances in lasers,expired intellectual property rights of the technique,cost reductions in electronic equipment,improved surface finish,wide range of material process ability, and smaller flow channels inside the part.However, SLM is limited due to the inherent nature of fusion physics.\n\nLaser-beam-induced melting involves heat transfer,phase transition,beam energy-material interaction,surface-tension-induced melt pool motion,material vaporization and ejection,and chemical reactions [1]. Controlling these physical conditions through process parameters is essential for production quality.For example,temperature decreases radially from the focus of the beam,causinga surface tension difference in the melt pool and thus creating a mass flow from the center of the melt pool, titled the Marangoni effect [2].Another complex mechanism in the melt pool is “key holing,”and it appears when the metal rapidly evaporates under the beam region, resulting in a recoil pressure of the molten region causing further penetration toward the preceding layers [3].Moreover, the Bernoulli principle,Young-Laplace equation,capillary effects,and supercooling serve as additional mechanisms that can cause defects such as surface rippling,roughness, balling,and hump.",

One approach for controlling part defects is to adjust process parameters [4].Process parameters are primarily beam power, beam diameter,beam velocity,hatch spacing,scanning strategy, powder properties,and temperature and environmental controls [5]. Determining the proper process parameters through validated experiments or process parameter maps [4] enables a desired track stability [6],fine microstructure [7],smooth surface topology [6],and targeted mechanical strength [8].Clymer et al.presented process design charts that can deliver the required part properties based on the data of the process maps of density,yield strength,surface finish,precision,and deposition rate [9].\n\nThe selective laser melting process's performance regarding the production speed can be evaluated based on the deposition rate [9,10],\n\n$$\nD R = t \\times h \\times \\nu\n$$",

Tang et al. simulated successive overlapping of the melt pools without lack of fusion voids for the standard processing parameters,and they observed the optimal hatch spacing for the semicircular melt pool sections as approximately $h = 0 . 7 \\times w i d t h$ [11].Increasing the layer thickness is a common approach for enhancing the deposition rate,while increasing the laser power is done to melt the larger volume.However,deeper melt pool formations can cause part defects.On the other hand,the hatch spacing size depends on the melt pool width and layer thickness, which are affected by process parameters.Alternatively,using multiple beams offers a production capacity increment,inwhich multiple beams simultaneously radiate on different locations of the same working plane to manufacture multiple parts [12].However,these systems remain within the limits of present process parameters when the production is assessed for each laser production zone.To improve melt pool control athigh power and speed, laser beam intensity distribution adjustment is a potential method for quickening the process.",

    "content": "Collimated fiber laser beam energy distribution on the focused working plane follows Gaussian distribution.Its high intensity at the center evolves temperature gradients in the melt pool,and its low intensity at the periphery of the beam induces a lack of fusion [13]. Furthermore,a high power density at the center causes deep penetration or key holing due to re-melting the preceding layer in exchange for excessive energy.Recent developments in optics enable the adjustment of laser beam intensity distribution with flat-top,inverse Gaussian, hollow,and other non-conventional beam shapes.At the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology (ILT),Buchbinder et al. [14] demonstrated specimen production with a flat-top $_ { 1 \\mathrm { m m } }$ beam diameter at $6 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ and an $8 \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 } / s$ build rate,resulting in $> 9 9 \\%$ density.

Therefore,various simplified models can be employed based on the focused region of the process [2O,21]. Thermal models at the microscale resolution provide the temperature distributions to measure the melt pool sizes [22] and to predict the microstructure evolution due to the thermal cycle of the process [23].Thermal-flow models focus on melt pool liquid behavior for understanding the dominant mechanisms such as the Marangoni effect,recoil pressure on pore formation mechanisms,spattering,and denudation zones [24].Laser track formation as a function of laser power,speed,and powder density has been studied with the meso-scale model that considers the effects of the individual particles [25].Furthermore, thermo-mechanical models have been studied to predict the part distortions and residual stresses in the part scale [26-28]. Thermal models that focus on melt pool geometry predictions can be employed in part-scale models with multiple-scale approaches and adaptive meshing techniques.Therefore,accurate melt pool predicting models are critical in defining the optimal process parameters based on melt pool geometry and in developing a building strategy.\n\nTable 1 Investigated laser power,velocity,and defocus parameters.   \n\n<table><tr><td>Power (W)</td><td>100,150,200,250,370</td></tr><tr><td>Velocity (mm/s)</td><td>200,400,800,1200,1600,2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Defocus distance (mm)</td><td>0,3,5,7,8,9,11</td></tr><tr><td>Beam Diameter (μm)</td><td>100,130,160,200,220,242,260</td></tr></table>\n\n![](images/df93db60cad0d2e750d4080db0b7525109b79d2deef66acee37a72c761f83839.jpg)  \nFig.1.Measured beam diameter with respect to focus offset position.",

    "content": "Another significant parameter in the simulations was the laser absorption efficiency.Heat absorption efficiency can alter due to powder size,powder bulk density, laser wavelength，and material composition.The powder absorptivity is higher due to the penetration of the incident light by multiple reflections of the powder surfaces [46]. Boley et al. measured metal flat surface and powder absorption efficiencies by exposing a $9 7 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ wavelength laser limited to $5 0 \\mathrm { W }$ cw laser power [47].Boley et al.presented O.4 and 0.74 absorption efficiency values of Ti-6Al-4 Valloy for a flat surface and the powder layer, respectively [47].Recent studies further demonstrate that absorption efficiency varies with laser power [34] and velocity [48].Absorption efficiency commonly increases as velocity decreases and power increases.Additionally,it increases with decreasing laser beam size [34,35].However,the increasing absorptivity can reverse in the low energy density regions in which the powder layer or rough surface becomes a smooth reflective surface due to the wetting of the beam interaction region [35].Therefore,in the simulations,the laser absorption effciency was set to a value based on the beam diameter,laser power,and velocity.To find accurate constant values for different combinations,the melt pool width and depth results were compared to the experimental values.The melt pool width and depth of the model were calculated by finding the corresponding melting point locations that causes the largest values from the top view and section view as in Fig.5(b),respectively.

    "content": "Experimental single bead trials for defocused beam scans enlighten the stable and defect-free regions of the process.However,different scan strategies,edge effects,and types of powder mixtures can cause variations in the melt pool sections.Thus,numerical modeling is critical.The results of the single bead FEA of the melt pool depth and width are illustrated in Figs.14 and 15,respectively. The results of six different process parameters for beam diameters of $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ， $1 3 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } .$ $2 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } .$ and $2 6 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ were compared to the experimental results.The simulation predictions are in close proximity to the experimental ones. The melt pool depth average error is $1 0 . 3 ~ \\%$ Moreover,17 of 24 comparisons feature an error deviation less than $1 0 ~ \\%$ ，High energy density combinations such as $3 7 0 \\mathrm { W }$ and $4 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ cause larger melt pool depth values due to the lack of fine detail of melt pool physics in the simulations (see Fig.14).However,melt pool depth predictions of the simulations remain high,and this serves as a clear sign to not use that parameter to eliminate defective product manufacturing.Melt pool width comparisons perform with an average of $3 . 8 ~ \\%$ error,and all are less than $1 0 \\ \\%$ .These results indicate that the proposed simulation setup,which includes a calibrated heat source with varying absorption values,is capable of accurately predicting the melt pool geometries in a wide range of process parameters with various laser beam diameters.",

    "content": "# 5.Conclusions\nThis work investigated the various process parameters of defocused single bead melt pool geometries to increase the deposition rate of Ti6Al-4V for the SLM process.The results indicated process parameters caused keyhole voids and unstable tracks.If the aspect ratio of the melt pool is greater than O.85,melt pool cross sections of the single beads begin to include void defects.A plot of VED versus $d / w$ or $\\Delta H / h _ { s }$ versus $d / w$ reveals linear behavior that helps to identify the defects.Moreover, the thresholds of the keyhole void defects and the unstable tracks are described by the VED and $\\Delta H / h _ { s }$ as a function of the $D$ The $\\Delta H / h _ { s }$ value behaves independently from $D$ for the void defect threshold.After selecting the capable process parameters from the findings,higher deposition rates are achievable with larger beam diameters and thicker powder layers without causing defective voids at high power process parameters.However, $2 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ limited systems deposit at high rates with the focused beam of $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$\n\nThe FEA model predicts the melt pool geometry close to the experimental results by implementing the varying absorptivity and heat source geometry.Absorptivity and heat source geometry shaping parameter c are defined as a function of the power,velocity,and beam diameter.High deposition rates can be simulated for the complex geometries.FEA model can pick up the lack of fusion regions,and FEA model results can guide for changing the process parameters according to the location of the part geometry to increase the deposition rates. Multi layered simulation and experimental study that compares the results at different part of the geometry with defocused beam suggested here is recommended for future work.\n\n# Declaration of Competing Interest\nNone.",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM),as opposed to traditional reductive manufacturing such as milling,turning and drilling,can build near-netshaped parts from the“bottom-up”ina layer-by-layer fashionas guided bya computer-aided drawing(CAD) model [1,2]. Machining and assembly steps can be eliminated through the use of AM,which can significantly reduce the fabrication and assembly time for complex Ti-6Al4V parts [3-5].AM can also be used to deposit new material atop damaged/worn components per user-designed profiles,enabling the repair of components that are otherwise too expensive or not feasible to replace [3-5]. The layer-wise nature of AM enables the production of parts with relatively complicated geometries,such as lattice-like metastructures [4] that were previously exceedingly expensive,if not impossible,to make.\n\nAM technology is referred to using several different designations [3,6,7].Depending on the specific apparatus used, these technologies may be categorized according to the energy source including laser, electron beam,and plasma;and material feedstock form including powder bed,blown powder,and wire feeding [6].Despite these differences,AM technologies (excluding sintering) share the same basic methodology - a mobile melt pool is formed by a directed energy source,which performs line scans according to a predetermined CAD scan strategy. These line scans are repeated to consolidate a layer of solid material,and the part is then built incrementally layer-by-layer in a “bottom-up”fashion.The setup and operations of AM machines is covered in great detail by numerous reviews [8-11] and will not be reiterated in this work.",

    "content": "The mechanical behavior of Ti-6Al-4V,like other alloys,is governed by its underlying microstructural characteristics.Pure titanium is allotropic, having a BCC crystal structure ( $\\mathrm { . } \\mathrm { | } \\mathfrak { s }$ phase) at high temperature and an HCP crystal structure ( $\\mathbf { \\dot { a } }$ phase) when cooled below $8 8 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ .The $\\mathsf { a } { - } \\beta$ transformation temperature ( $\\mathrm { B }$ -transus） is sensitive to chemical composition,and thus,alloying elements can be used to stabilize the $\\alpha$ and/or $\\beta$ phase in a desired temperature range [1O]. Commercial titanium alloys are categorized into three families based on their phase composition at service temperature: (1) $\\alpha$ alloys and commercially pure titanium, (2) $\\beta$ alloys,and (3) ${ \\tt a } + { \\tt \\beta }$ dual phase alloys.The most widely used titanium alloy is Ti-6Al-4V,which is a ${ \\mathfrak { a } } + { \\mathfrak { \\beta } }$ dual phase alloy.\n\nDuring production from a melt, Ti-6Al-4V solidifies as $\\beta$ phase then transitions to its ${ \\tt a } + { \\tt \\beta }$ dual phase structure as it cools.If cooling rates are high enough,a martensitic transformation can occur,which produces an $\\scriptstyle { \\mathtt { a } } ^ { \\prime }$ phase that is metastable at room temperature.This phase is common in laser processed additive manufactured (AM) Ti-6Al-4V. Both the $\\alpha$ and $\\mathbf { \\Delta } \\mathbf { a } ^ { \\prime }$ phases nucleate and grow from phase boundaries, i.e. $\\beta - \\beta , \\alpha - \\beta$ ,and $\\alpha ^ { \\prime } \\cdot \\beta$ depending on the cooling rate.The morphology of the $\\alpha$ and $\\scriptstyle { \\mathtt { a } } ^ { \\prime }$ phases reflects the prior $\\beta$ microstructure that existed at high temperature.The evidence of the prior high temperature $\\beta$ structure in the room temperature microstructure is termed prior- $\\beta$ microstructure.",

This can lead to a textured final $\\alpha ^ { \\prime } - \\alpha \\cdot \\beta$ microstructure [12] and contributes to the anisotropic mechanical/fatigue properties [1O,15].Optimal AM build parameters generally favor the formation of elongated prior $\\beta$ grains along,or at a certain angle to, the build direction [12,14,16].

    "content": "AM Ti-6Al-4V parts typically contain microscopic defects,such as gas entrapment and flat lack-of-fusion (LOF) defects [3,4,17-22]. Such defects can degrade fracture toughness and ductility under monotonic loading [12,18,19,21-33]. Under cyclic loading,pores and LOF defects can overshadow any effects of microstructure,substantially degrading the fatigue life by serving as crack initiation sites (CIS) [22,34-36].The LOF defects tend to be aligned perpendicular to the build direction.The presence of these LOF defects can result in strong anisotropy in the fatigue strengths of AM samples [22].Optimization of AM process parameters has been shown to be successful in reducing the defect size and population by reducing LOF defects [37].However,porosity, partially due to gas entrapment, still exists and reduces the fatigue strength of many AM materials. The presence of these gas entrapment pores in AM Ti-6Al-4V has significantly limited its use in fatigue critical applications and has driven recent research efforts to better understand the link between defects and mechanical behavior.Currently,much of the focus has been directed toward understanding the relationship between defect size and location on the resulting fatigue behavior [38]. To improve the mechanical properties and deal with the inherent defects, post-process treatments such as hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and traditional heat treatments or a combination of the two have proven necessary [39-43].These post-process treatments affect both the defect size and distribution as well as the final microstructure.\n\n![](images/e0e502ff24146751d806d74ccec9f7c497f13088e70bda632a626a308b160f1b.jpg)  \nFig.1.VarietyosucuresulirAdbsetHiangfullaela）oalpeoar Widstaeeisd",

    "content": "Typical AM Ti-6Al-4V microstructures are shown in Fig.1.It can be seen that with post-processing heat treatment (HT) and/or HIP,microstructures similar to conventional wrought Ti-6Al-4V can be produced - such as the fully lamellar structure shown in Fig.la and duplex/bi-modal structure shown in Fig.1b.However,as discussed in later sections,HT schedules for AM parts often differ from the wellestablished wrought procedures.Without post-process treatments,the microstructure of as-built Ti-6Al-4V fabricated from electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) typically consists of a very fine Widmanstätten/basket weave structure (Fig.lc) due to the high cooling rates $( 1 0 ^ { 3 } \\sim 1 0 ^ { 5 } \\mathrm { K } / s$ [47]) combined with beam heated substrates $( \\sim 9 7 0 \\mathrm { K } ,$ higher than the decomposition temperature of martensitic phases) [28,29 32].Laser-based AM has even higher cooling rates $( 1 0 ^ { 4 } \\sim 1 0 ^ { 6 } \\mathrm { K } /$ s [47]) and build plates that are typically not heated to the extent of EBPBF processes,and therefore tends to produce martensitic structures [32,48],which contains ultra-fine acicular features (Fig.1d and e show typical $\\scriptstyle { \\mathtt { a } } ^ { \\prime }$ martensite phase).An ultrafine Widmanstätten (Fig.1f) can also result from laser-based AM processes, since the repeated reheating during the fusion of subsequent layers may bring the part temperature above the martensite decomposition temperature [49 32].The microstructure of Ti-6Al-4V is determined by the specific thermal history that a region of AM material has experienced, namely the repeated meltingsolidification-reheating-cooling during the AM build and post-build heat treatment procedures.Below,a description of the continuous cooling behavior and the resulting phases of Ti-6Al-4V is provided for a broad range of cooling rates (from $0 .",

In this case, the size of the colonies is governed by the prior $\\beta$ grain size.At increased cooling rates,the tendency for nucleating new colonies increases,and colonies will nucleate from existing ones.This leads to a reduction in the average colony size.The resulting microstructure is often referred to as Widmanstatten or basket weave (Fig.2e),and is commonly observed in AM Ti-6Al-4V parts. Overall,higher cooling rates cause finer“weaving\"; for example,the microstructure in Fig.1f (wire-fed laser deposition,faster cooling) is much finer than Fig.ld (electron beam melting,slower cooling) and contains inter-protruding $\\alpha$ plates which indicate interrupted/poorly-developed $\\alpha$ colonies due to rapid nucleation of $\\alpha$ phase.During the $\\beta \\to \\alpha + \\beta$ phase transformation, the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ phase stabilizing elements,namely Al and $\\mathrm { v }$ respectively,are redistributed into the respective phase.If Ti-6Al-4V is cooled ata sufficiently high rate,a total martensitic transformation is expected and pure $\\scriptstyle { \\mathtt { a } } ^ { \\prime }$ or $\\alpha ^ { \\mathfrak { n } }$ ,ora combination of $\\scriptstyle { \\mathtt { a } } ^ { \\prime }$ and $\\boldsymbol { \\alpha } ^ { \\mathfrak { n } }$ phases,are expected as shown in Fig. 2f.

    "content": "This subsection has shown that the phase composition and structure of an AM Ti-6Al-4V part is dependent on its experienced thermal history,including initial cooling，and subsequent in-build reheating/ cooling and annealing (such as one experienced with heated build plates). The phase structure ranges,in a decreasing order with cooling rate,from martensite（ $\\acute { \\alpha }$ and/or $\\alpha ^ { \\prime \\prime } )$ ，fine Widmanstätten $( \\alpha + \\beta )$ coarse Widmanstätten,to fully lamellar $( \\alpha + \\beta )$ .The martensite is metastable and is subject to decomposition due to the repeated reheating during AM process.For ${ \\tt a } + { \\tt \\beta }$ microstructures,the thickness of individual α plates,as well as the size of the α colonies,decrease with increasing cooling rate.As will be discussed in Part I, these dimensions of the $\\alpha$ colonies may affect the tensile and fatigue strengths of the Ti6Al-4V parts,and are of critical relevance.\n\nMany factors have been found to affect the cooling rate during AM. For instance,as was mentioned earlier,the EBM AM technologies have much higher ambient temperature compared to laser AM technologies, sometimes as high as $0 . 5 \\mathrm { T _ { m } }$ ,leading to much lower cooling rates,as evidenced by much coarser Widmanstätten structures [28,29,52,53].It has been shown [32] that for LB-PBF,by varying the processing parameters,such as powder feed rate,scanning speed and laser power, cooling rates and the corresponding coarseness in phase structures can be controlled to some degree.In addition,the geometry of the build affects the cooling rate.",

Consistent with intuition,this map suggests that at low solidification rates and high thermal gradients,the $\\beta$ microstructure is fully columnar;and at low thermal gradients and high solidification rates,the microstructure is fully equiaxed.Considering that grain size is often controlled by the cooling rate (the product of G and Q),Fig.7a provides a helpful illustration into how $\\beta$ grain size and morphology are related to the characteristics of the thermal field,with the solid black lines representing constant prior $\\beta$ grain size.For instance,when G and Q are adjusted along the black solid lines, $\\beta$ morphology changes from fully columnar to fully equiaxed,while the grain size is constant; within this same domain,when the cooling rate is changed (such as along the light red and blue arrows),grain size can be altered while maintaining the same grain morphology.\n\nThe parameters of the solidification map,G and Q,can be controlled through AM processing parameters,offering the opportunity to produce AM Ti-6Al-4V parts with tailored $\\beta$ microstructure.For example, Gockel et al. [8,13] have translated the solidification map to a processing map (Fig.7b) for the wire-fed,electron beam deposition of a single bead. Their work shows that high absorbed power and scan velocity leads to fully equiaxed microstructure,while low absorbed power or scan velocity leads to fully columnar microstructure. The processing map utilizes parameters such as absorbed power and scanning velocity,which are directly tunable in several AM processes allowing limited microstructural control depending on the desired application.",

This is particularly true for fatigue performance,where microscopic features can act as CIS and substantially impact performance [60,61]. First,the layer-by-layer nature of the AM build process makes surface roughness unavoidable when geometries involve surfaces that are not parallel to the build plane or its normal direction.This has often been referred to as the stair casing effect [62].Second,in powder bed approaches,the existence of partially melted particles attached to the surfaces leads to surface roughness. In both cases,the phenomena are outside the realm of traditional materials and specific to AM.Surface roughness is significantly influenced by process type,geometry and orientation, powder size,and process parameters such as laser power, scan rate,scan-line or hatch spacing,and layer thickness [63].",

    "content": "The layer-by-layer production process in AM results in a high dependence of the surface characteristics on the inclination angles,which are defined as the angles between the manufactured parts with respect to the build direction. As-built LB-PBF specimens fabricated in a diagonal direction with respect to the build plate show a distinct surface roughness.The roughness is higher for the downward-facing surfaces (down-skin) compared to the upward-facing surfaces (up-skin) [60,67]. For both up-and down-skin surfaces that are fabricated diagonally from the substrate,the staircase effect can increase the roughness.Down-skin surfaces pose an even bigger challenge as there is minimal part volume beneath the edge.Since these surfaces are practically built on the powder，whose thermal conductivity is approximately an order of magnitude lower than the solidified section,more powder particles are partially melted to the surface resulting in much higher surface roughness than the up-skin surfaces [6O].This dependence of surface roughness on location within the inclined specimen can be correlated to the experienced thermal history via a linear heat conduction model [45].The down-skin locations of two different geometries both had higher surface roughness compared to the up-skin surfaces,and accordingly,the thermal model predicted higher temperature histories on the down-skin surfaces [45],as shown in Fig. 8c.",

Down-- skin surfaces with angles less than $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ from the substrate typically associates with poor surface quality and are usually avoided by reorienting the part or by adding support structures.The reorientation is preferred to avoid the need for building of support structures,as their removal from the part can lead to additional defects such as burrs contributing to even higher roughness [69].Orientation of the part during fabrication can therefore have significant effects on the surface roughness of AM parts and must be taken into consideration during the design stages prior to fabrication.",

Stylus surface profilometers have been widely used to evaluate the surface quality of the AM parts and,based on a study published in 2016, the common measurement method used for AM was stylus-based contact profilometry [70].\n\nThe mean value of several measurements carried out for each sample over a constant length is usually used to express the surface roughness of said sample $\\left( \\mathrm { R _ { a } } \\right)$ .

    "content": "When the energy input is insuficient, previous layers are poorly melted, the bonding between consecutively deposited layers is compromised,and LOF defects form between layers. Such defects are typically well-aligned with the deposited layers and are flat,crack-like entities with sharp edges and irregular shape (such as the ones shown in the left image of Fig.1Oa [8O]).For AM technologies using powder as the feedstock,un-melted particles can often be found in such defects [23].The sharp edges of these defects lead to stress concentrations, which can reduce the fatigue strength of a Ti-6Al-4V part depending on loading direction [22].On the other hand,if the input energy is excessive,the melt pool can develop excessive convection currents and stronger vapor recoil forces,resulting in instability and an increase in ejected spatter [78,79].The unstable melt pool can lead to the formation of voids and/or gas bubbles in the melt pool,which can survive through the solidification process and stay within the solidified Ti-6Al4V parts (shown in the right image of Fig.1Oa). This process is also otherwise referred to as keyholing.The shape of the porosity in this case is generally spherical due to the dominance of surface tension in the liquid metal. The pores may or may not contain gas,depending on whether a shielding gas is used (gas entrapment） and the type of feedstock (the gas containing pores in the powder due to gas atomization process),and may be difficult to remove depending on the solubility of the contained gas [81].\n\nThe energy input is typically quantified as a power density (E), which is the amount of energy that is absorbed per unit volume of material per unit time.For the powder bed fusion process, it depends on the power of the heat source $( P )$ ， energy absorption coeficient $( g )$ deposited thickness (t), hatch spacing $( h )$ ,and scan speed (V),as seen in the following relationship [37,48,77,82]:\n\n$$\nE = { \\frac { g P } { V h t } } ,\n$$",

For the data from these studies to be comparable and meaningful, the power density has been normalized based on the optimum value (i.e. $E / E _ { \\mathrm { o p t } } )$ and plotted versus the part density relative to their wrought counterparts ${ ( \\rho / \\rho _ { \\mathrm { w r t } } ) }$ as its function in Fig. 10b.\n\nFig.lOb confirms that there exists a window for power density in which an optimum part density as high as $9 9 . 9 9 \\%$ can be achieved (Region II, corresponding to the center image in Fig.1Oa).It should be noted,however,that powder quality plays a role in AM part porosity as well which optimized process parameters may not be able to overcome [83]. On both sides of this window,i.e.in Regions Iand III, the relative part density starts to decrease.It may be seen that scatter exists in Regions Iand III,even within the same data set.This is mainly due to the energy absorption rate $( \\alpha )$ being a function of several parameters, such as $P , V , f , t , h ,$ etc.,and that the true power density is difficult to obtain.",

These LOF defects can be much more detrimental to the mechanical properties of the material as they are often slit or crack shaped with high stress intensities at the edges.This suggests that if porosity is inevitable,a slight shift in power density towards the higher end (Region II) might be beneficial. In this case,although the relative part density decreases, the flat,LOF defects can be replaced by spherical pores,which corresponds to much lower stress concentrations.",

    "content": "Characterization and control of AM defects and their effect on durability of AM parts is a key area of concern that should be dealt with for qualification and certification of safety critical AM parts [84]. Due to the nature of AMdefect formation and the inability to fully eliminate them,the susceptibility of AM materials to premature failure as a result of these defects needs to be carefully assessed.To support such an assessment an appropriate characterization of such defects is necessary. Such information can be later used for probabilistic damage tolerant assessments of AM parts based on the exceedance curve fora given class of material defects.Moreover,variability in AM machines process parameters and/or beam source/material interactions can cause inconsistencies in the defects [85],microstructure,and consequently variability in the mechanicalperformance.Therefore, reliable stochastic techniques should be established to use the data gathered from the characterization process and to account for the prospective variability between various segments of a large component or between various parts manufactured under the same conditions.\n\nThe characteristics of defects such as size,morphology,location, and distribution have shown key roles in the fatigue performance of AM fabricated parts.Therefore,reliable methods should be implemented to investigate these parameters. Some common non-destructive methods of particular interest for defect characterization are the Archimedes method,gas pycnometry,and X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) [86]. Archimedes method and gas pycnometry,while widely used,are not capable of capturing some of the most critical information regarding severity of the defect such as size,location,and distribution.X-ray CT, on the other hand,can resolve defects in 3D space giving quantitive information on their volume,location,and distribution,in addition to tracking the effects of post-processing on the defects [87].",

It is generally believed that a larger defect is more likely to cause failure compared to a smaller one and the fatigue strength of a component is governed by the largest defects [91],although the sensitivity of the material to defect characteristics such as size is a function of microstructure,defect location, and environmental and mechanical loading conditions.The proximity of the defects to the surface could affect the local stress at the defect even under uniaxial loading conditions. The maximum stress intensity factor in uniaxial fatigue loading for an internal defect can be approximated as $K _ { m a x } = 0 . 5 \\sigma \\sqrt { \\pi \\sqrt { a r e a } }$ and for surface defects is approximated as $K _ { m a x } = 0 . 6 5 \\sigma \\sqrt { \\pi \\sqrt { a r e a } }$ ，where $\\sigma$ is the nominal applied stress and area is the defect area normal to the applied stress [92].This means that,considering two defects of similar size and shape with one at the surface and the other internal, the surface defect would be considered more detrimental to the fatigue resistance than the internal defect.",

Therefore,the concept of Extreme Value Statistics (EVS) was implemented to estimate the largest expected defect in a larger volume considering the population of defects in a limited number of samples.This is accomplished by focusing on the upper tail of the defect distribution.Murakami [95] had developed an EVS method to predict the maximum inclusion size in a large volume of steel based on Gumbel distribution and Shi et al. [96] laterapplied a variation of EVS,based on the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD),to carry out this prediction.\n\nRomano et al.[97] applied EVS for analyzing X-ray CT scan measurements to qualify ALSiloMg AM parts.They observed the variability of the defect size distributions using probability plots.Considering the cubic root of the volume or the square root of the projected area as the geometry factor,they observed that the data points over a certain size tend to align,implying that defect sizes exceedinga threshold can be fitted by an exponential distribution,as was previously confirmed for inclusions in steels.\n\nGumbel distribution function is presented as:\n\n$$\nF _ { \\mathrm { G } } \\left( \\mathbf { x } \\right) = \\exp ( - \\left( - \\mathrm { e x p } \\left( \\frac { \\mathbf { x } - \\lambda } { \\delta } \\right) \\right) )\n$$",

Liu et al.[101] showed that a narrower particle size distribution increased the flowability of the powder and resulted in parts with increased hardness and tensile strength.The increase in flowability was attributed to the reduction of agglomerates,which increase the friction between flowing particles,since particles of similar size tend to flow independently. Nandwana et al. [1O2] also reported variations in particle size distribution affected the porosity of EBM Ti-6Al-4V with coarser powder sizes leading to more porosity and lower fatigue lives.Interestingly,a wider particle size distribution was shown to increase the final density of the parts due to finer particles filling the vacancies between larger particles.These results suggest that the ideal particle size distribution is wide enough to give good powder bed density yet narrow enough to not degrade the flowability of the powder and that initial powder quality could be highly influential on part performance.\n\n![](images/5adc24b243d5d695a2240abb61b6afde0f65f22a10f94db5deb1d0fabbf111e0.jpg)  \nFig.13.Gumbel plot for distribution of the largest defect sizes gathered with block maxima sampling from gage section of annealed and HIP'ed tubular LBPBF Ti-6Al-4V machined surface specimens from two micro-CT scanned specimens for each condition,each divided into eight sub-volumes in the build direction.

Studies have reported that increased powder recycling can increase these interstitial elements [1O3] while others have reported no significant change in interstitial element composition [1O4,1O5].

    "content": "Scanning strategies have also been investigated regarding their effect on achieving part densities that surpass what is achievable solely through energy density optimization.Tammas-Williams et al. [109] suggested that for an EBM method,the interior hatching of a selectively melted area was responsible for the generation of most defects.It was suggested that pores are pushed along the solidification front of the melt pool,after which they are dumped once the beam changes direction.This results in aggregation of pores at the edges of the hatch lines. At the contour of the melted area, however,the formation of pores was not observed and concluded to be a result of a contour remelting strategy allowing gas-entrapped pores an opportunity to escape.This work suggested that employing different scan strategies or re-melting layers could be beneficial in improving the overall density of fabricated parts,even though this may increase build time.In fact, Gustmann et al. [110] showed that re-melting entire layers of a Cu-Al-Ni-Mn shape memory alloy led to increased relative density and improved ductility.\n\nIn addition to improving the defect distribution throughout an AM part,scan strategies are also used to manage the introduction to residual stresses that are inherent to the rapid cooling of LB-PBF.AM systems mostly deal with residual stresses by rotating the laser direction after each layer is melted.The changing direction of the laser results in the successive layer to change the directionality of the residual stress in relation to the previous layer due to the scanning direction.In addition to this rotation of the laser direction,each part slice is often broken into smaller segments or strips reducing the overall length of the laser scanning vector allowing each layer to compensate for the anisotropic effect of the previous layer [111].A more in-depth discussion on the effects of residual stresses and how to deal with them is given in Section 5.1.",

    "content": "As mentioned previously,residual stresses are often formed in AM parts due to the large thermal gradients that arise between the previous layers and the melted layer.The cooler solidified layers previously deposited laterally restrict the thermal expansion of the layers above, often within the plastic regime due to the high melting temperatures. Once these moderately compressed layers cool and begin shrinking themselves,they tend to bend upwards but again are restricted by the previous layers resulting in a tensile residual stress component at the surface acting parallel to the build direction. The residual stress adds up with each successive layer until the stress is so high that the previous layers or support structure attaching the part to the substrate fails causing the part to bend upwards and likely lead to build failure.Even in the absence of this build failure,successful builds that manage to resist the buildup of residual stresses during the fabrication process can release these stresses upon removal of the substrate and have excessive dimensional inaccuracies.\n\nWhile much effort has been given to scan strategies as a means to reduce residual stress during fabrication,stress relieving parts before removal from the substrate is still often a critical post-processing step. Even with the reduction of process induced residual stresses,stress relief is often necessary for parts that require high dimensional accuracy as well as the removal of the detrimental effects of the residual stresses for fatigue and fracture critical parts. Stress relieving temperatures are often much lower than the critical/recrystallization temperature so that the microstructure is mostly unaltered.Baufeld etal. [49] showed that stress relieving treatments at $6 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ for $4 \\mathrm { h }$ did not significantly affect either the microstructure or mechanical properties of wire AM Ti-6Al4V.",

    "content": "The heat treatment procedures can be divided into two categories in which the maximum soak temperature is below the $\\beta$ -transus temperature (sub-transus) or above $\\beta$ -transus (super-transus). Sub-transus heat treatments are performed in the ${ \\mathfrak { a } } + { \\mathfrak { \\beta } }$ field to obtain globular primary $\\alpha$ grains in a matrix of secondary $\\alpha$ plates.These sub-transus heat treatments and the resulting microstructure give rise to a combination of high strength and ductility.On the other hand,super-transus heat treatments are performed in the $\\beta$ field and result ina fully lamellar or Widmanstätten (basketweave) microstructure which has lower ductility compared to the globular $\\alpha$ in transformed $\\beta$ microstructure.The Widmanstatten microstructure,however,has higher fracture toughness as a result of the lamellar grains acting as crack deflectors.\n\nAs discussed in Section 2,additive manufactured Ti-6Al-4V parts produced by LB-PBF have very fine microstructures,either ultrafine Widmanstatten or martensite,shown in Fig.1,as a result of the higher cooling rates.Most importantly,the martensitic microstructure is not ideal as the ductility is severely limited by the fine HCP crystall structure and the propensity towards intergranular failure along prior $\\beta$ grain boundaries.Heat treatments are thus necessary for LB-PBF Ti-6Al4Vparts to improve part ductility that meet standard specifications such as ASTMF1472 and F2924 [107,129]. The unique combination of columnar prior $\\beta$ grain structure and the fine acicular martensitic grains contained within,however,results in insuficient mechanical properties for LB-PBF Ti-6Al-4V when using traditional heat treatment procedures [39-42].",

Heat treatments that approach the $\\beta$ -transus temperature show increased sensitivity to cooling rate as well as lower cooling rates resulting in coarser $\\alpha$ plates,however,the maximum soak temperature is still the most influential aspect of the final $\\alpha$ plate width [41,42].While these sub-transus heat treatments effectively eliminated the martensitic microstructure,the columnar prior $\\beta$ microstructure is preserved.",

Vrancken et al.[42] also showed that holding temperatures above $\\beta$ transus results in grain growth along the width of the prior $\\beta$ grains leading to a semi-equiaxed microstructure.For heat treatments that surpass the $\\beta$ -transus temperature,the cooling rate becomes the most influential aspect on the final microstructure [41,42]. Furnace cooling after super-transus heat treatments have been shown to result in the Widmanstatten microstructure for LB-PBF Ti-6Al-4V [4O-42].While this basketweave microstructure results in inferior ductility compared to the fully lamellar ${ \\tt a } + { \\tt \\beta }$ microstructure obtained from the subtransus heat treatments,it is expected to provide better performance in fracture critical applications.\n\nTo obtain the best combination of strength and ductility for Ti-6Al4Valloys,a bimodal microstructure is often desired.For wrought Ti6Al-4V alloys this is achieved by thermomechanical processing,however,for AMalloys net shape or near net shape parts are preferred to reduce processing steps.Ter Haar and Becker [4O] showed that a bimodal microstructure could be achieved for AM Ti-6Al-4V by taking advantage of the fragmentation that occurs in the $\\alpha$ phase during high solid solution temperature region annealing procedure.This allows for globularization of the $\\alpha$ phase that is retained after quenching and a subsequent low solid solution temperature region annealing procedure. The low solid solution temperature region anneal allows for the decomposition of the $\\scriptstyle { \\mathtt { a } } ^ { \\prime }$ phase to a lamellar ${ \\mathfrak { a } } + { \\mathfrak { \\beta } }$ microstructure.This bimodal microstructure was shown to greatly improve the ductility of LB-PBF Ti-6Al-4V [40].",

    "content": "HIP treatments may also be a necessary post-process treatment for Ti-6Al-4V parts fabricated by additive manufacturing techniques due to the inherent porosity associated with AM.It has been established that AM Ti-6Al-4V parts subjected to HIP treatment and a subsequent surface machining have high cycle fatigue performance on par with traditional wrought materials [3,13O-133]. The improvements in fatigue resistance for HIP'ed AM Ti-6Al-4V components can be attributed to a combination of improved local microstructure surrounding defects and a reduction in defect size [80,l31,l34].Li et al.[131] showed via quantitative analysis of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) images the existence of a more refined microstructure near defects in the HIP'ed material (Fig.14).This is consistent with observations in HIP compaction of Ti-6Al-4V powder [134-137] and the microstructure evolution that occurs during the typical wrought Ti-6Al-4V processing route [138-141]. The study [131] suggested that the improved HCF performance by HIP treatment is a combination of decreasing defect sizes below a threshold and changing the microstructure that surrounds defects.",

    "content": "Standard HIP processes for wrought materials may not be applicable for additive materials as they typically involve a post HIP heat treatment.For LB-PBF,the introduction of inert gases such as Ar restricts full healing of the pores as Ar does not easily diffuse through the microstructure [81].During HTof LB-PBF parts the reduction of the pore size compresses the Ar resulting in a residual pressure in the pore and a tensile residual stress along the pore boundary.Successive heat treatments after HIP may re-open these pores due to the residual pressure introduced by the compression of Ar filled pores reversing some of the benefits of the HIP treatment [1O9]. This again highlights the need for AM specific post-processing HT schedules that take into account the inter-relationships between process-structure-property (PSP） of additive manufactured parts.Regardless,if heat treatment or HIP is required,stress relieving is often necessary to prevent parts from distorting after removal from the plate.",

Therefore, depending on the presence of lack-of-fusion voids, strong anisotropy in fatigue behavior of AM Ti-6Al-4V may exist.Even within an optimized process window,variations in process and powder conditions can significantly affect the size and distribution of the defects and the resulting mechanical performance of additively manufactured materials.",

Conventional post-process thermal processing for wrought Ti-6Al-4V, such as annealing/heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing, do not typically give similar results for additive manufactured Ti-6Al4V parts as a result of their unique as fabricated microstructure.While successful thermal treatments have been shown to result in a variety of microstructures that are comparable to traditional wrought microstructures,leading to comparable mechanical properties,these procedures contrast significantly to the conventional Ti-6Al-4V heat treatments.\n\nGiven its physical origins,the fatigue behavior of AM Ti-6Al-4V is highly sensitive to many variables associated with the additive manufacturing process.The unique microstructure as well as the defects associated with additive manufactured Ti-6Al-4V parts makes fatigue life prediction inherently more difficult compared to wrought Ti-6Al-4V.To this point,a thorough review on the characterization of AM Ti-6Al-4V fatigue behavior,which is carried out in Part II of this series,is necessary to detail not only the complex nature of fatigue behavior in regard to AM but also the varying degrees of fatigue performance observed for different AMprocesses， procedures，and systems.

The selected processing parameters are laser power,scan speed, hatch spacing,laser patern increment angle,and heat treatment (HT) condition.The present work revolves around ANN modeling and using a wide parameter range and a large number of test samples under ASTM standards as well as adding HT to the DOE to analyse the simultaneous effect of HTand changing process parameters on surface characteristics.A large and precise data set with high generality and reliability obtained by 3750 profilometries on 125 samples.The contribution of this paper is using ANNas an accurate tool in surface modelingand characterizing the efective parameters on the surface ofLPBF parts.The existence phenomena and governing factors were explained by introducing new parametric mechanisms in rheology of melting pool.In AMof metals,the variation of average roughnessin overlapof hatches can be 5-7 times higher than the centre of the track.",

    "content": "Ti-6Al-4V is one of the most common titanium alloys with particular properties such as high specific strength,excellent corrosion resistance and good fatigue resistance.These properties characterize it as one of the best materials for lightweight and high strength components used in aerospace and biomedical applications.Surface quality and dimensional accuracy are among the critical factors in manufacturing for such applications,especially for parts which are assembled in multi-component systems.Selective laser melting (SLM) is additive manufacturing (AM) technology,sub-classified as in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF),that generates poor surface quality,often making it necessary to carry out further post-processing and metal cutting[1-3].\n\nDuring LPBF,a few defects may occur with negative effects on the process and surface quality of the produced parts. Porosity is a wellknown problem in AM of metals [4],generally referring to pores created during laser material processing which are mostly classified into two types: keyhole and balling. Keyholes generally occur when a huge amount of energy is focused on a small area resulting in the formation of a melt pool which is narrow and deep.Gasses trapped in this region form aclassical keyhole shaped void [5,6].Semak andMatsunawa[7] found that balling defects in laser material processing were mainly created due to the high flow of fluids in the melt pool that is affected by temperature and surface tension.Teng et al. [8] reviewed the occurrence of defects in the laser melting process and how it can be modelled.A literature survey of thermal modelling in metal laser sintering shows the development of various models by combining material thermal nonlinearity, latent heat, laser heat source distribution and (interaction between) the laser beam and powder bed,leading to the generation of various surface qualities [9].",

    "content": "Powder characteristics and process parameters are key factors affecting surface quality during the LPBF process.The connections between the foremost LPBF parameters (laser control thickness,scanning speed, and layer thickness),properties of the powder and geometrical attributes of single tracks have been investigated by Yadroitsev [1O].This investigation shows smaller particles can fill small voids between larger powder particles and improve density and surface quality. Finer particles provide a larger surface area and absorb more laser energy, thus generating bigger melting pools and improving surface quality. The surface quality of SLM CoCrMo parts has been shown to be affected by process parameters. Single layer analyses on surface quality were carried out to identify optimum input parameters.For the manufacture of parts with a smooth surface,the scan space should be kept low.Also during the melting process,surface tension affects the roughness [11,12]. The particle size and distribution was also shown to change the surface quality of LPBF parts. Processing of powders with coarser particles results in higher porosity and a rougher surface [13-15].By increasing the scan speed,balling was observed due to low wettability,reduced contact between substrate and melt,and Rayleigh instability. Large overlap occurs with low hatch spacing,which increases the roughness of the surface [16].Thijs et al.[17] assumed that the formation of pores in a Ti and Al-based alloy is associated with powder deposited around the melt pool within a layer and an accumulation of the surface roughness across the layers and also the formation of keyholes.These phenomena were therefore thought to affect surface roughness and decrease the value of $\\mathrm { R _ { a } }$ and surface quality of produced parts [18].",

    "content": "In order to observe the contour profile of the melt pool with respect to the scan types,LPBF parts were fabricated with various hatch spacing while keeping other process parameters constant. Controlling and optimization of the process parameters and modification of the initial design are key factors in the tailoring the surface quality of AM parts. For instance,the scan speed is directly proportional to a physical density where it reaches a maximum at higher scan speeds for the same energy density.However, increasing the scan speed reduces the surface quality of the parts.Therefore,it is necessary to optimize the process parameters in order to achieve a high-density material with good surface quality.However,the optimization of process parameters is not an easy task as most of the materials exhibit different conductivity and reflectivity [16,21-25]. Savalani et al.[26] showed that a preheating process improves the surface of magnesium parts used in bio-implant applications.This isalso shown for Ti-6Al-4V parts made by SLMwhere the numerical response surface (RSM) revealed that surface roughness and microstructure are greatly associated with process parameters and preheating.However, preheating has a lower impact on microstructure compared to scan speed [27]. Using larger powers slightly decreases the surface roughness by reducing the formation of balling and increasing wettability of the melt pool [28,29].A fractional design approach [30] has been proposed to improve the surface quality when a complex objective function exists and by optimizing process parameters in SLM of steel $1 7 { - } 4 \\mathrm { P H }$ to improve surface quality. Surface properties of the parts fabricated by LPBF highly depend on each single laser-liquefied track and every single layer,and additionally the quality of the interaction between them.",

    "content": "The most common ways to deal with the issue of dimensional accuracy and surface qualityis by experimental models,by means of design of experiment,ANN and analyse of vriance (ANOVA) and different optimization methods [31].To model and predict the effect of process parameters on part quality various approaches such AI-based methods are available.Our previous research showed that ANN exhibit the potential to predict and analyze the effect of process parameters on density with high accuracy [32].To optimize the density,shape,dimensional accuracy and surface quality of LPBF parts,utilization of laser surface re-melting (LSR) has been suggested [33,34]. Post-processing such as metal cutting,ball-pinning and laser or electron beam remelting are suggested to solve the mechanical and surface problems of PBF parts [12,35-38].\n\nAll discussed methods to analyse the LPBF process are highly reliant on the accuracy of transfer functions that is related to the number of test sets.Usinga small number of test specimens due to the cost of each experiment results in generating low accuracy of the presented models. Also,in the reviewed investigations the average roughness was reported which can vary significantly between two subsequent measurements and is associated with the place of measurement (e.g.in overlap regions or at the center of the hatches).",

    "content": "# 4.Analysing the obtained data from DOE\nTo validate the accuracy and the trend of the obtained data,signalto-noise (SN) ratio needs to be calculated based on the Taguchi SN relationship.Generally,signal-to-noise shows the ratio of signal or the obtained values to the noise (errors). This criterion shows the accuracy and performance of the measurement in each experiment. In the production of LPBF parts,one of the problems for as-built samples is low surface quality so improving the roughness is a goal.Therefore,the criteria‘smaller is better'was adjusted in such a way to minimize the average surface.When different levels of each factor influence the response contrarily‘main effect' becomes an important statistical factor [43].In this case,horizontal lines show less‘main effect'and vertical lines are representative of sharper effects of each input on each output.The analysis of‘main effect'and SN is shown in Fig.2.If the lowest value in‘main effect'plots are equal to the highest values in SN plots,the designed experiment and obtained data are correct.In other words,the trend of mean values should be reverse of signal-to-noise diagrams which are related to the criteria of the smaller is better $( \\mathsf { S } / N = - 1 0 ^ { * } \\mathrm { l o g } ( \\Sigma ( \\mathrm { Y } ^ { 2 } ) / \\mathrm { n } ) )$ As it can be seen in Fig.2 the‘main effect'and SN plots show the trend of this experiment is correct and no significant noise and problems were observed.\n\nDifferent methods can be applied to model and optimize the process parameters on mechanical properties and surface quality of PBF parts. For instance,artificial intelligence (AI) based methods or mathematically based modeling such as Gaussian process-based surrogate modeling [44-46]. In this research, based on our previous experiments and subsequent performance of AI,we used ANNs to model the process.",

    "content": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are numerical approach models stimulated by the behavior of biological systems.This tool can draw logical relationships between inputs and outputs in multi-dimensional space and are used to predict,model and analyse the contribution of each input to the obtained results.Moreover, this tool can show the interaction of different parameters on the results and explain the linear and non-linear behavior of input parameters on outputs [47-49]. ANNs are based on three stages; train,test and recall/validation.In this method initial parameters such as momentums and weights are tuned in training and to solve the problem of falling into localized errors/traps, a test stage is necessary.Process validation is carried out in the recall stage.Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) ANN is the proper tool for modelling and prediction of an industrial process (such as AM) when the inputs and outputs are not linearly separable combinations of each other.\n\nThe Qnet program was used to model the process and post process parameters.This software has the capability to show the interaction of parameters on the modeled results. In this research process parameters ofAM including LP,SS,HS,PA and the post-process parameter that was HT were selected as input parameters and $S _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ was selected as an output. With AM the outputs are not linearly separable combinations of inputs and therefore we used an MLP neural network.The best results were obtained by using a 5-layer network $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$ with Sigmoid transfer function between layers and 5o,ooo iterations.To train and test the network 17 and 3 datasets have been used respectively,and the remaining 5 datasets were used in the recall process.The fitting procedure for MLP neural networks is shown in the Appendix.\n\nTable 4 Results of the cross-validation.

The localized melting and micromotion lead to removing the bulge defects but causing an increase of peaks and valleys per unit area. LPBF works under controlled atmosphere.However,it has been reported that a small amount of oxygen $( 0 . 2 \\% )$ and nitrogen $( 0 . 1 2 \\% )$ may exist in the bulk of the materials so the solution of these elements in titanium may lead to decreasing the melting point temperature on the surface of the samples and causing micro-flowing which is shown in Fig.6(E) [59,6O].This is consistent with what we found from ANN modeling (Fig.5) where it was shown that with increasing heat treatment temperature the value of average surface roughness increases (red area).",

Surface roughness is a function of melt pool size and energy density.In the case of higher energy density (laser power) partial melting occurs in a wider area and overflow at the surface,leading to a reduction of surface quality.In this case,more peaks and troughs are found on the top surface of the samples [27].The width of the track is associated with LP,SS and interaction of these two parameters.In the case of higher LP and lower SS (Fig.7(A)), by increasing the width of the melt pool, temperature increases and higher Marangoni convection occurs in the center of the melt pool and bigger mush area and heat affected zone is observed.The gradient of speed for melting flow is zero in the mush areas,therefore; higher temperature accumulates in these regions that leads to increasing thermal stress,and decreasing surface tension.Therefore,in higher energy density smoother surface was observed in agreement with the literature [61,62].\n\nAccording to Eq.

Moreover, vapor pressure is required to keep the holes open due to the balance of forces between surface tension and hydrostatic force on the liquid/solid interface at keyhole walls. Therefore the pressure increases by increasing depth and decreasing radius of the keyhole [69,7O].

    "content": "Another reason for increasing $S _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ for the case of smaller HS values can be related to the promotion of particle attachment in the overlaparea.Larger overlap leads to enabling the previously fabricated track to absorb more energy and increases the temperature. The results would be a bigger heat affected zone and more partially melted powder attached to a solid interface causing larger average roughness [16].\n\nFigs.5,7 and 1O show that SS has the lowest impact on the value of $\\mathsf { S } _ { \\mathsf { a } }$ consistent with Alrbaey et al.work on the re-melted surface (postprocessing) [34].\n\nFigs.5D,7C and 10C show that by decreasing PA the value of $s _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ has a raising trend. The reason is related to coverage of overlap (rough area) by the center of subsequent layers (smooth area) [65].Fig.11 shows when the second layer has lower PA then the area of coverage of overlap for the previous layer is a parallelogram A'BCD'while for higher PA $( 9 0 ^ { \\circ } )$ this coverage is rectangular ABCD.It is known that the surface of a parallelogram is $A ^ { \\prime } B \\times B D ^ { \\prime }$ is higher than the surface of the rectangularABCD.Therefore,the coverage of overlap by subsequent layers is a direct function of PA.In other words,the lower PA the lower overlap area and based on the mentioned notes and mechanisms (in lower PA) subsequent layers cover the surface problems such as balling,cracks and keyholes. Thus,increasing PA reduces the quality of the average surfaces.",

    "content": "# 6.Conclusions\nThis research investigates the key contribution parameters influencing average surface roughness and shows a numerical model to predict $S _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ and provides practical information to explain the behavior of process parameters on average roughness and enhance the surface quality of LPBF parts.This can therefore help to minimize post-treatment such as machining and polishing.The obtained data can be used to adjustthe process parameters to produce higher surface quality, especially when using hybrid (e.g. LPBF $^ +$ Remelting) processes for more quality improvements.\n\nResults showed that for Ti-6Al-4V alloy printed via LPBF method, heat treatment above the beta transus temperature causes lower surface quality due to formation of some defects such as localized surface melting,balling,unmelted and residual particles.Surface quality decreases at Higher LP and lowers SS because of the Marangoni effect that causes the formation of mush area and increasing the chance of keyholes. $S _ { \\mathrm { a } }$ is a direct function of HS due to the fact that at larger HS values smaller overlap occurs so the chance of adherence of unmelted particles becomes less.Due to geometric coverage of subsequent layers on former layers,lower PA provides better surface quality.\n\nThis research showed ANN is an accurate tool to predict the value and trend of $\\mathsf { S } _ { \\mathsf { a } }$ when different process and post process parameters are applied.\n\n# Declaration of Competing Interest\nWe confirm that we don't have a conflict of interest with other scientists in the field.",

    "content": "Due to its excellent mechanical properties such as good stability, good corrosion resistance,and high specific strength, the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V is widely used in many industries [1].However,its high cost and challenging machinability somewhat restrict its use in conventional manufacturing methods,namely forging and casting [2].\n\nHowever,the use of Ti-6Al-4V in selective laser melting (SLM) powder bed fabrication,an additive manufacturing (AM) process,offers the benefits of recycling the remaining unprocessed metal powder, geometrical freedom in product design,and time and energy efficiencies [3,4].In this process,ametal powderis applied layer-by-layer in building up a formed product,each layer anchored to the previous one by the complete fusion of the metal powder by a laser beam.The laser spot moves along a scanning pattern which is generated and controlled by a CAD model of the part to be built. Fig.1 presents a schematic of a typical powder-bed fusion system.\n\nSLM is an attractive manufacturing process for the aerospace,automotive,and other technological industries [5-7].However，many factors affect the final printed products,namely,the laser power,laser scanning speed,the thickness of the metal powder layers,the printer's accuracy,and other printing conditions.Additionally,the ranges of these factors are quite wide.For example,the maximum laser power can reach more than $1 8 0 \\mathrm { W }$ ,the laser scanning speed can reach7 $\\mathbf { m } / s$ and the metal powder layer thickness is unlimited.Using an unsuitable process parameter can result in low-density powder fusion,which would have a significant impact on the mechanical properties of the printed product [8,9]，and could cause unexpected behavior like cracking [1O],balling[11],or deformation [12].",

    "content": "Many papers have described high-density Ti-6Al-4V products fabricated by SLM[13-15],but the results show that there is variability in part density obtained by several different process parameters.Many papers have tried to optimize SLM process parameters by applying, for example,response surface methodology (RSM),Taguchi robust design methods [16],direct optimization [17],D-optimal design of experiments(DOE)[18],using energy density [19],and Doehlert matrix design [2O]. It is clear in all of these approaches that investigating process parameters independently is incorrect because the printed product quality is a function of relationships between several crucial process parameters.\n\nSimilar energy densities can be attained by different combinations of the crucial process parameters,such as layer thickness,hatch distance,laser power,and laser scanning speed [2l].However, to achieve reliable printed quality,the SLM process requires highly experienced users,is expensive,and the experimentation is time-consuming.(Density can be improved by employing heaaat treatment methods [22].)A fully dense SLM product is not always a target that must be achieved at all costs,and it should be negotiated with other specifications.\n\n![](images/e3926f955dfa3a57d92da92ec14709d4cd554cbdc7e7e8bdaea163f7946165d3.jpg)  \nFig. 1.

Here, the four investigated process parameters were laser power,laser scanning speed, hatch distance,and layer thickness; the levels of each parameter were selected by experience and some references [29-32].The database that was selected for the experiment was created by thoroughly combining each level of each parameter.In this method,a total of 2048 test cases representing the SLM 3D printing technique and the manufacturer cartography were obtained. The process parameters for the experiments and their levels are shown in Table 3.\n\nAfter printing,the SLM processed parts were tested for density.A GR-200 analytical balance (A&D Company,Ltd.,Tokyo,Japan） was combined with that company's AD-1653 density determination kit to measure the density of the printed parts. The density of the samples was obtained according to the weight of the sample in air,the weight of the sample in liquid,and the density of the liquid (distilled water).\n\n# 2.3.Network parameters\nIn this research,ANN implementation, training,and the optimization system were developed using the Python programming language [33],in which the TensorFlow library [34] was applied. The ANN included four input nodes as the four process parameters,while the output was the relative density of the printed part.Large differences in the values of the four investigated process parameters as the inputs,and the required product quality as the output,complicated the ANN learning process.Therefore,all inputs and the output were previously normalized by using a standard normalization:\n\n$$\nz = { \\frac { x - \\mu } { \\sigma } }\n$$",

    "content": "Overfittng is a problem that often occurs in machine learning,when the model is very accurate on the training data but will probably not be very accurate on the testing data. Generally,when overfiting happens, the model learns the noise in the training data instead of the actual relationships between variables in the data.To avoid overfitting,the weight decay regularization and the dropout methods are used.Weight decay is a method to prevent the weights from growing too large unless it is really necessary,by adding a term to the loss function that penalizes large weights [39,40]:\n\n$$\nE ( w ) = E _ { 0 } ( w ) + \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\lambda \\sum _ { i } w _ { i } ^ { 2 }\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a regularization parameter governing how strongly large weights are penalized. $w$ is the weight vector which contains all free parameters of the network. In this research, $\\lambda = 0 . 0 5$ was used.\n\nDropout is another method to prevent overfitting.In the dropout technique,units are randomly dropped from the neural networks during training [41-43]. In this research, the probability of retaining a unit in the network was 0.7.\n\n# 2.6.Optimizing algorithms\nThe optimization algorithm is shown in Fig. 3 and the following:\n\n1 First,develop an ANN.   \n2 Calculate the density ratio from the generated data that were\n\n![](images/858ff8dbe541b7e9b002897a0b7cf16b7d79e4f64560ccc01399525b1c0cb615.jpg)  \nFig.3.Algorithms for optimization system.\n\ncreated by combining levels of the four process parameters.The laser power changes from $8 0 \\mathrm { W }$ to $1 8 0 \\mathrm { W }$ in $5 \\mathrm { W }$ increments.The laser scanning velocity values change from $8 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ to $2 5 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ in $1 0 0 { \\cdot } \\mathrm { m m } / s$ increments,while the layer thickness and hatch distance change from $2 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $8 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and $3 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } - 1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,respectively, in $5 \\mathrm { - } \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ increments.",

    "content": "# 4.Conclusions\nThe density of a product manufactured by selective laser melting of Ti-6Al-4V was optimized by determining four optimal process parameters:laser power,laser scanning speed,layer thickness,and hatch distance.The developed optimization system applied supervised deep learning as a core function,using process parameters as input and product relative density as output. The dropout and weight decay methods addressed the overfitting problem that often happens in deep neural networks.The predicted outputs were compared with the user requirement,and the parameters of which the outputs satisfied that requirement were indexed conversely. The productivity of the SLM printing process was used to filter the indexed data anew to finally obtain the optimal process parameters.To assess the performance of the developed system,the optimal parameters were set for a final SLM printing,and the relative density of the new fabricated part confirmed that it met the user requirement as predicted by the SLM optimization system.\n\n# Supplementary information\nSupplementary information will be provided upon requesting the author in the article titled “Optimization of selective laser melting process parameters for Ti-6Al-4V alloy manufacturing using deep learning\".\n\n# Acknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the ICT R&D program of MSIP/IITP.

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM),commonly referred to as three-dimensional (3-D） printing,is a production method which offers the ability to build near net-shapes with complex geometries (Dutta and Froes,2O15).3-D printing yields a significant degree of freedom in design,allowing parts to be made using a single continuous process in comparison to traditional subtractive methods,that often require numerous machining steps to achieve the same finished part complexity and geometries.The technology is increasingly being adopted for precision component fabrication in the aeronautical, medical device and automotive sectors,due to its ability to produce consolidated parts for specific end-use applications (Thomas, 2016). As a result, AM can significantly reduce material usage and lead processing times,along with cost savings for small batch runs. While there are a range of processing technologies used for the AM of metallic parts,one of the most widely applied commercially is the Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) technique. This method of manufacturing uses a raking mechanism to evenly spread the metal powder across the work area,which usually involves layer heights of $2 0 { - } 2 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .The metal powder is then exposed to an energy source (electron beam or laser beam),which scans the bed following a specific toolpath,melting or sintering the powder into the desired geometry.",

    "content": "This paper is focused on the printing of Ti-6Al-4V alloy parts. There is significant interest in this alloy for biomedical applications,due to its corrosion resistance,biocompatibility,high specific strength,superior mechanical properties and fracture toughness (Toh et al.,2Ol6). Ti-6Al4Valloy parts are generally printed using the laser beam PBF process. Both continuous and pulsed wave laser modes can be used for melting powders in laser based technologies.In continuous mode, the output power remains constant independent of time;whereas in pulsed mode, the laser fires for short specified periods.The latter yields a localized high energy discharge which instantaneously heats up the material with minor thermal energy dissipation to the surrounding material due to the formation of relatively narrow tracks,which might cause increased porosity.In contrast, the continuous wave mode results in a greater diffusion of energy to the surrounding materials,which can result in a larger melt pool with inferior geometrical accuracy (Caprio et al., 2017).There have been a relatively limited number of publications however,which have reported on the mechanical properties of the alloy printed using the PBF-LB process,examples are given in Table 1.It is clear from this table that there are significant disparities in the literature between the mechanical properties of the resultant Ti-6Al-4V alloy parts.These variations are likely to be due to the different PBF-LB processing conditions,which for example influence factors such as the thermal cycling and cooling rate.Amongst other factors influencing the mechanical performance of the printed parts such as scan strategy, surface finish and post-process heat treatments.These factors will have a significant impact on the printed alloy microstructures.\n\nTable 1 Examplesofalpoereordiauefdiaactelh coefficient of friction (COF).

    "content": "In the AM process,the cooling rate is influenced by many different factors such as chamber temperature,part geometry,argon flow,layer height, energy deposition etc.During printing,the laser melts the alloy and the area directly heated is known as the‘melt pool'.Thijs et al. (2010) reported that a change in energy input for example will result in a change in melt pool dynamics,geometry and solidification rate.The melt pool size is typically in the order of one to two hundred microns, this limits macro-segregation and causes very high,localized cooling rates of $\\sim 1 0 ^ { 3 } - 1 0 ^ { 8 } ~ \\mathrm { K } / s$ (Loh et al., 2015). This suggests a significant deviation from the global equilibrium of $\\sim 0 . 5 \\mathrm { K } / s$ used in casting of these alloys (Dehghan-Manshadi et al., 201O). Mukherjee et al. (2018) and Yang et al.(2Ol6) observed that this rapid cooling and thermal cycling,due to the remelting of subsequent layers,has a direct impact on the characteristics of the final microstructure and can cause the build-up of internal stresses. Zitnansky and Caplovic (2004) and Ding et al.(2Oo2),are examples of authors who have highlighted the importance of the microstructure on the mechanical properties of the printed alloy parts.",

    "content": "It is reported that in the PBF-LB process,several parameters are responsible for the formation of the as-built microstructure,including laser power, hatch distance,exposure time,focal distance,scan speed, scan strategy etc. (Khorasani et al. 2019). Gong et al. (2014) propose that variations in laser input energy has been shown to be one of the main factors influencing the melt pool. Yadroitsev and Smurov (2010) reported that if insufficient energy is applied,instabilities can occur during the melting process,due to a decrease in the diameter of the cylindrical melt tracks.Under optimal printing conditions,there is likely to be an overlap between hatch distance and melt tracks.However,under non-optimised print conditions,splashing of the molten metal may occur from the surface of the thin discontinuous tracks, which in-turn can induce the formation of spherical defects (\"balling\" effect) within the part (Gong et al., 2015). Kasperovich et al. (2016) and S.Biamico et al.(2011) both observed that porosity defects are primarily generated due to insuffcient laser energy.These defects are reported to be more detrimental to the parts mechanical properties compared to those generated with excessive laser energy. Conversely, Mezzetta (2Ol7) reported that the use of high laser energy has been shown to have negative effects on the density of the final part. Murr et al.(2Oo9) for example,highlights that the formation of pores of $\\sim 5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in diameter are associated with entrapped gas bubbles due to aluminium (in Ti-6Al-4V) evaporation,known as the“keyhole”effect.\n\nConventional Ti-6Al-4V allys are routinely produced by forging",

    "content": "Considering the AM process for the fabrication of Ti-6Al-4V alloys, the rapid solidification results in the formation of a fully metastable hexagonal close packed (HCP) fine acicular martensitic phase by diffusionless, shear-type transformation (Zitnansky and Caplovic (2004)). The $\\beta  \\alpha$ transformation at fast cooling rates can result in a highly stressed microstructure (Vandenbroucke and Kruth,2Oo7).These α plates typically contain a high density of crystal defects such as stacking faults and twins compared to the equilibrium α phase (Qazi et al., 2001).Kobryn and Semiatin (2OOl） studied the efect of laser power and scan speed on microstructure in direct energy deposition process which is another type of laser additive manufacturing technology. Based on their findings,the average grain width is directly influenced by both the incident laser energy deposited during printing and subsequent effect on cooling rates.They also reported that using high laser energy and low scan speed reduced the localised cooling rate,which resulted in an increase in grain width.Furthermore,variation in microstructural features such as prior $\\beta$ grains size and $\\alpha$ colony size are known to impact mechanical properties of parts,directly influencing the slip length during deformation (Litjering,1998).\n\nTo the authors knowledge there have been no reports which analyse the effect of systematically altering the AM laser power on the morphological and mechanical properties of the printed Ti-6Al-4V parts. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of laser power variation in the range 1oo-4oo Watts,on the net shape,microstructural evolution,as well as the mechanical properties of the as-built parts.",

This powder exhibits a spherical morphology and is reported by the provider to have low thermal expansion and conductivity (see Appendix A for material specification).Printing studies were carried out using a production scale Renishaw system (RenAM 5OoM) that operates under an inert gas atmosphere.This system uses up to a $5 0 0 W$ pulse wave emission laser with wavelength of $1 0 7 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ ，modulated with $_ { 1 0 \\mathrm { m s } }$ delay between exposures.The laser follows a Gaussian beam profile that is achieved through the use of a dynamic focusing system which uses two galvo mirrors,correcting the near-parabolic focal length change required as the beam travels across the bed, maintaining the beam in focus.Additionally,this AM system is equipped with the InfiniAM Spectral system for in-situ process monitoring,which provides visual feedback on the laser energy input and the level of emissions emitted from the melt pool during processing (Renishaw Plc,2018). The data is recorded and then reconstructed into both 2-D and 3-D views in near real time.The software facilitates a visual output (based on colour change),associated with changes in the level of laser energy used during printing. The laser emissions are given as variations in pixel contrast from O to 1,where O represents no emission,while 1 represents the highest possible emission.The emission measurements obtained in this study were $0 . 2 3 \\ \\pm \\ 0 . 0 2$ $0 . 3 9 ~ \\pm ~ 0 . 0 4$ and $0 . 6 2 \\ \\pm \\ 0 . 0 5$ for the 100,250 and $4 0 0 W$ ，treatments respectively.These results are the average obtained from 433 print layers/sample.For each power, these were positioned at 5 locations across the build plate,as illustrated in Fig.1.In this study laser power (P) was systematically altered in the range of 1oo-4oo W.",

    "content": "As demonstrated by the optical images of the alloy printed at 100 and $4 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ laser power (Fig.2),the former part exhibits a rough, inhomogeneous surface morphology.In contrast, that obtained at 400 W exhibits the distinctive‘meander' scan pattern used,which produces mutually perpendicular hatch lines parallel to the borders,due to the applied hatch angle of $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ (Thijs et al., 201O). Small sized metallic balls with diameters in the range of $2 5 \\mathrm { - } 5 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (satellite particles),were observed throughout the surface of the as-built part. Satellite formation mainly occurs due to insufficient melting of powder particles which cannot penetrate the melt pool before melt pool solidification (Mumtaz and Hopkinson, 2O1O). The dimensional measurements given in Table 2 demonstrate the small increase in the printed coupon size with increase in laser power.Analysis of these geometrical features showed that a laser power of $1 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ produced parts with dimensions close to that of the specified CAD design of $1 0 . 0 \\times 1 0 . 0 \\times 1 0 . 0 m m ^ { 3 }$ Compared with this design,the overall diameters of the printed samples increased by 0.60, 2.02 and $4 . 1 7 ~ \\%$ ，when printed using laser power of 10o,250 and 400 W,respectively.To obtaina close correlation between the CAD and printed part dimensions for a given power, it would be necessary to optimise the laser beam compensation value used for each laser power (Ning et al., 2OO6). The value used in this work was fixed at $1 2 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .A feature which noticeably increased with laser power was the border thickness of the part (Fig.2),that obtained at $4 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ samples is nearly 4 times $( \\sim 0 . 2 ~ \\pm ~ 0 . 0 6 \\mathrm { { m m } } )$ ）higher than the designed dimension of $0 .",

The relatively uniform morphology of the printed parts would indicate that for this study,the level of laser power applied across the powder bed is relatively homogenous. As detailed earlier,the Renishaw RenAM 50oM melts the powder using a modulated wave emission,a schematic of this is shown in Fig.3. Under ideal conditions there is an overlap between hatch distance and melt tracks;incorrect overlapping of adjacent tracks can result in increased porosity.The width of the melt track,which is a product of the hatch parameter,increased notably from an average of 2o4.1,212.6 and $2 3 5 . 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,with increased laser power from 1o0 to 250 and $4 0 0 W$ respectively (Table 2).This increase is attributed to the increase in energy input at the higher laser power which in turn can affect the melt pool homogeneity and size,inducing larger melt tracks.",

These voids and keyholes are likely to have a deleterious effect on the part's mechanical properties. Other processing factors such as the argon flow regime can influence powder morphology during the fabrication process and cause increased porosity (Ferrar et al.,2O12).In this study however,little variation was shown for both geometry and porosity for parts printed across the build chamber,despite variations in argon flow regime over the print bed.It is concluded therefore,that for the experimental conditions investigated, the influence of the argon regime is minimal on pore formation,compared with that associated with laser energy.",

    "content": "Based on microscopy and SEM examinations of the printed parts obtained for all three laser power investigated,it was concluded that the as-built microstructures are martensitic.This observation is similar to that reported by a number of other authors for PBF-LB printed parts. Upon inspection of the top layers of the parts,it was found that for all samples there were thin needle-like structures,scattered across the surface,which is a characteristic of $\\propto ^ { ' }$ phase (Vracken et al., 2012).The direction of these needle-like martensitic phases, is randomly organised across all samples, which can be associated with the rapid cooling rates, resulting in erratic phase formation and growth. Examination of the parts side view reveals long,columnar grains which grow epitaxially during the build. The average widths of the prior $\\beta$ grains measured closest to the polished top surface layer are 110,197 and $2 0 8 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ for the 100,250 and $4 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ ，respectively.The widths of the prior $\\beta$ grains appear to increase with an increase in laser power.Additionally, it can be observed in Fig.4 (a) that due to high levels of porosity in the sample, the prior $\\beta$ grains grow perpendicular to the pore independent of the build direction,whilst parts with reduced porosity exhibit grain growth towards the print substrate, in the z-plane (Fig. 4 (c)). Kobryn and Semiatin (200l） observed in their studies that upon increasing incident energy, prior $\\beta$ grain width increased as the cooling rates decreases. Thus,increased energy deposition by increase in laser power results in decreased cooling rates and also results in an increased level of remelting of the underlayer,which promotes the grain growth phenomena. The scan strategy used will also have a direct influence on the grain structure.",

    "content": " As the design of the part used is small, there could be increased localised heating around the borders,particularlyas the laser is turning,which may promote some grain growth.Furthermore,the grain structure could be clearly observed in the case of the 250 and $4 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ samples,however in the case of the $1 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ samples, the morphology exhibited an irregular and inconsistent grain structure (with a standard deviation of $5 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ between grain widths).A further factor influencing grain growth is the increased number of pores formed in within the structure formed using the $1 0 0 W$ laser power. The length of the primary $\\acute { \\alpha }$ martensite needles were found to increase with increased laser power. Yang et al. (2016) reported that $\\mathbf { \\Delta } \\mathbf { a } ^ { \\prime }$ martensites always extend across the entire parent $\\beta$ phase,however in this study the primary $\\alpha$ martensite needles were found not to fully extend across this $\\beta$ phase. This is possibly due to the formation of dislocations and twins in the prior $\\beta$ grain as a result of thermal cycling,which interrupts primary $\\acute { \\alpha }$ needle growth.Furthermore, based on 20 measurements per printed sample,the average lengths of the primary $\\propto ^ { ' }$ martensitic needles were found to be 94,114 and $1 4 8 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,for the100,250 and $4 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ samples,respectively (Table 4).Wu et al.

    "content": "A possible reason for the changes observed in both prior $\\beta$ grain width, $\\alpha$ thickness and length with increasing laser power,may be due to higher melt pool temperatures,giving rise to increased re-melting of the underlying layers.These higher temperatures may also induce some localised annealing.This in turn could promote epitaxial growth of the prior $\\beta$ grain and increased grain coarsening rates with refined martensitic $\\propto$ phase (Wu et al., 2004). For the $1 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ samples,a large amount of fine acicular martensite of varying lengths was obtained.In contrast，the 250 and $4 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ samples appeared to possess a more homogeneous distribution of these acicular martensite needles,however with a higher aspect ratio.Yang et al. (2Ol6) reported that the hierarchical martensitic structure is directly influenced by the energy deposition and thermal cycling.\n\nAnother factor which can influence the type of martensitic structure is the presence of a higher concentration of $\\beta$ stabilizing V.At high energy depositions due to the evaporation of aluminium (Al),it is reported that a higher V content is present,which favours a more ‘basket weave’ type structure (Ahmed and Rack,1998). These basket weave structures have been reported to directly influence the surface mechanical properties,increasing the microhardness of parts (Li et al., 2017).In summary,there is a direct relationship between $\\alpha$ needle morphology and the laser power used in the fabrication of the sample.A reduction in needle thickness,accompanied by an increase in needle length,occurs with increased laser power.This also results in a more homogenous crystal microstructure.\n\nXRD and TEM Selected Area Diffraction Analysis (SAED) analyses of the Ti-6Al-4V alloys were carried out in order to obtain a more detailed understanding of phases present in as-built structure.Fig.5 illustrates",

Yang et al.

    "content": "Mercelis and Kruth (2OO6) in their studies reported a highly distorted crystal structure,when they analysed the microstructure of PBFLB Ti-6Al-4V.TEM imaging of the as-built samples in this study also depict a staggered morphology with high density of dislocations at the three laser powers investigated (Figs.6 (a-c)).This staggering is commonly associated with the slip of the equilibrium $\\alpha$ phase HCP (Aggarangsi and Beuth,2Oo6).This is likely to be associated with the thermally induced residual stresses that form as a result of the rapid cooling,causing the phase morphology to be highly distorted.These results are commonly seen in the formation of $\\alpha ^ { ' }$ martensite,which is often induced via thermal stresses.Based on the SAED analysis,the crystal structure of the martensitic phase (250 W) agrees with HCP $\\mathbf { B } =$ [0002], $d _ { 1 0 0 } ~ = 0 . 2 5 8 \\mathrm { n m }$ and $a = 0 . 2 9 5 \\mathrm { n m }$ ),which is consistent with the XRD measurements belonging to the $\\alpha ^ { ' }$ phase as seen previously. Additionally,structural defects such as twinning associated with the rapid cooling during the additive process (Fig.6d) were observed across all samples.Moreover, Inverse Fast-Fourier Transform (IFFT)analysis of the brightfield TEM images revealed the nanostructure of the samples to be highly distorted.Fig.7 depicts a high-resolution HR-TEM image of overlapping planes obtained for the alloy printed at 25o W.By means of visual inspection and measurements of the angle between planes,a value of $3 0 ~ \\pm ~ 2 ^ { \\circ }$ was found which represents the mismatch between planes.

    "content": "Micro/nanostructural analysis showed that increased laser energy deposition promotes both grain and needle growth.Additionally, it was observed that the application of the $4 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ laser power promotes a reduction in internal residual stress of parts,with no direct change in the nanostructure of the crystals.These observations suggest that even though microstructural tailoring can be achieved,with variation in energy deposition through changes in laser power,the overall as-built microstructure still remains martensitic.The crystal structure is largely dependent on the rate of cooling,which in the case of AM printed alloy is still in the order of $1 0 ^ { 3 } ~ \\mathrm { K } / s ,$ ，which gives rise to the martensitic structure (Murr et al., 2009). To achieve an $( \\alpha + \\beta )$ structure, powder bed heating would be required above the $1 7 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ temperature currently used, this would help to further reduce the cooling rate during printing (Ali et al., 2017).",

    "content": "Pin-on-Disk measurements of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy samples yielded dynamic coefficient of friction (COF) values in the range 0.62 to 0.69 (Table 5).These are in the range typically found for this alloy in the literature (Qu et al.,2Oo5).A possible explanation for the slight variation in friction obtained for the printed alloys is the presence of varying levels of martensitic protrusions on the surface of samples, from each sample group.Furthermore,visual inspection of the samples surface after wear testing exhibited large amounts of wear debris. Zivic et al.(2Ol1) explained that due to the direct contact between the oxide layers of the sample and the ball, the formation of debris and chemical bioproducts occurs.\n\nAnalysis of the wear tracks obtained after 36oO s of abrasive wear, using profilometry showed noticeable differences across the laser powers used. The tracks obtained for theloo W coupons displayed an uneven,aggressive wear with an average track depth of $5 . 3 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and wear volume of $0 . 0 6 ~ \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ .

Qualitative inspection indicated that the wear profile for parts formed using 1oo W laser were less homogeneous,compared to those obtained for parts printed at higher power.This observation is supported by literature reports,where the microstructure has been shown to have a direct influence on the wear resistance of the titanium alloy surfaces (Ding et al.,2Oo2 and Khorasani et al., 2019).",

The values are generally higher than the $3 4 9 \\mathrm { H V }$ typically obtained forthewrought mill annealed alloy(AMS4911). Chandramohan et al.(2O18) studied the heat treatment effect on the mechanical properties of additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V.Results obtained in their study are in good agreement with that observed in this study,where a COF of 0.62,wear depth of $0 . 0 8 ~ m m ^ { 3 }$ and hardness of $3 6 0 \\mathrm { H V }$ were obtained for as-built parts.In summary,it is concluded that there is a clear correlation between laser input energy and surface properties.Both wear resistance and hardness increasing for samples fabricated at higher laser powers.With increase in power there was a reduction in porosity and a change in grain morphology.This included the formation of wider prior $\\beta$ grains with longer primary $\\alpha$ needles, exhibiting a decrease in thickness.In addition, there was a relatively small variation in mechanical results for parts printed with the same power,at the 5 locations across the build plate.This observation supports the results from the InfiniAM in-situ measurements,which indicates that there was a relatively homogeneous exposure to laser energy at each of the 5 print locations.This result is similar to that observed by Egan and Dowling (2019),who reported that a broadly linear relationship between input energy, the mechanical properties of the part and the data generated by the process monitoring system.",

Moreover,it appears that parts produced at $1 5 0 \\mathrm { W }$ showed greatest variation in tensile properties,yielding at around $4 0 0 \\mathrm { { M P a } }$ .This variation is most likely associated with the higher level of porosity present when compared to tensile samples produced using high powers.It has been reported that during tensile deformation,pore coalescence is the main crack formation mechanism (Ellyin, 2O12 and Krakhmalev et al., 2016).Additionally,Castany et al. (2Oo7） proposed that during deformation,all gliding dislocations have an a-type Burgers vector, resulting in a large density of rectilinear long screw dislocations.This suggests that during tensile testing,agglomeration of smaller α' needles occurs within the parent prior $\\beta$ grains almost perpendicular to the active Burgers vector,restricting lattice accommodation resulting in brittle fractures.Ali et al.(20l7) and Liütjering et al.",

    "content": "It was demonstrated from this study that variation of laser power, results ina distinctive influence in the microstructure and mechanical properties of as-built parts.Whereby high energy deposition resulted in a more homogenous microstructure with superior tensile properties. Optimisation of the point distance results in alloy parts exhibiting superior mechanical properties and lower standard deviation,when compared to laser power and exposure time at equivalent energy densities. XRD and grain analysis suggests that microstructural tailoring is achievable,however changes in the overall crystal structure appears unattainable through simply changing key parameters in the additive manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V alloy.The peak shift observed in the XRD results for parts printed at the lower and higher laser powers,would indicate some reduction in the level of thermal residual stress for the latter parts.While the focus of this paper has been particularly on laser power and to a lesser extent on exposure time and point distance, amongst the other parameters which will influence the properties of the printed part are hatch distance,focal distance,scan speed and scan strategy. Just to stress that the effect of these parameters will also have to be considered in order to optimise part performance.",

    "content": "Abstract: Ti-6Al-4V is a popular alloy due to its high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance. Many applications of additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V using selective laser melting (SLM) have reached technology readiness. However, issues linked with metallurgical diferences in parts manufactured by conventional processes and SLM persist. Very few studies have focused on relating the process parameters to the macroscopic and microscopic properties of parts with different size features.Therefore,the aim of this study was to investigate the efect of the size of features on the density, hardness, microstructural evolution,and mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V parts fabricated using a fixed set of parameters. It was found that there is an acceptable range of sizes that can be produced using a fixed set of parameters. Beyond a specific window, the relative density decreased. Upon decreasing the size of a cuboid from $( 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\mathrm { m m } )$ to $( 1 \\times 1 \\times 5 \\ : \\mathrm { m m } )$ , porosity increased from $0 . 3 \\%$ to $4 . 8 \\%$ . Within a suitable size range, the microstructure was not significantly affected by size; however, a major change was observed outside the acceptable size window. The size of features played a significant role in the variation of mechanical properties. Under tensile loading, decreasing the gauge size, the ultimate and yield strengths deteriorated. This investigation, therefore,presents an understanding of the correlation between the feature size and process parameters in terms of the microscopic and macroscopic properties of Ti-6Al-4V parts manufactured using SLM. This study also highlights the fact that any set of optimized process parameters will only be valid within a specific size window.\n\nKeywords: additive manufacturing; titanium alloys; selective laser melting; microstructure;   \nmechanical properties; tensile behaviour.",

    "content": "The application of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy is known in diverse industries,such as aerospace,automobile, chemical,and medical ones [1-3]. This popularity is attributed to the low density-to-strength ratio, exceptional corrosion resistance,and biocompatibility of this $\\alpha + \\beta$ Titanium (Ti) alloy [4]. In Ti-6Al-4V, Ti is alloyed with 6 wt $\\%$ aluminium (Al), which is an $\\alpha \\cdot$ -stabiliser, and $4 \\mathrm { w t } \\%$ vanadium (V), which is a $\\beta$ -stabiliser lowering the transus temperature [5]. Hence, Ti-6Al-4V exists as a mixture of $\\alpha + \\beta$ equilibrium microstructure at room temperature. Even though it is known for its high performance in various aspects, the industrial use of Ti-6Al-4V remains limited to specific applications due to its high cost. The major cost manifests from the processng steps involved in the manufacturing of Ti components, which require high energy inputs while creating a significant amount of waste [6-8]. Therefore, the need for alternative manufacturing methods is growing, and additive manufacturing (AM) is one of the top contenders.",

    "content": "AMplays an essentialrole in mitigating the aforementioned issue with conventional manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V [9]. In any AM proces,a computer-aided design (CAD) file is used as an input, and it is then primarily fabricated in a layered pattern [10]. Due to the layered approach, AM alows high design complexity freedom [11]. Apart from the well-established complexity advantage, AM permits minimal raw material wastage, except in the case of support structures [12]. This study focusses on the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process, commonly known as selective laser melting (SLM) [13]. The operational concept of the technology can be found in [14]. The material flexibility and ability to produce components with high precision due to small beam diameter (typically $2 0 { \\mathrm { - } } 1 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } } )$ lasers are some of the added advantages of SLM when compared to other metal-based AM technologies [15,16]. SLM has reached a point where nearly $1 0 0 \\%$ $( 9 9 . 7 \\%$ or more) dense parts can be fabricated [17]. SLM parts have shown evidence of possessing comparable or even often superior mechanical properties when compared with traditionally manufactured parts [18,19]. Complexity freedom of AM and the exceptional properties of Ti-6Al-4V opens the opportunity for numerous high-end applications [20,21]. For instance, the \"buy to fly\" ratio for conventionally produced large aerospace parts can be in range of 8-12:1 and sometimes as high as 30:1, whereas it is approximately1.5:1 in the case of components manufactured by AM [22].",

    "content": "The increasing use of SLM, especially with Ti-6Al-4V, in high-value applications, necesitates the manufacturing process becoming highly consistent and reliable. However， defects，such as hydrogen porosity,lack-of-fusion pores,keyhole defects, cracks,and impurities,are common [23,24]. The significant influence of defects on the mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V parts is not unusual[25,26]. Hence,it is essential to analyse and suppress defect formation to ensure a reliable manufacturing system for large-scale industry acceptance. Gibson et al. [27] reported that melt pool size, layer thickness, scan speed, scan strategy， etc.， are highly significant parameters to manufacturing high density components using SLM. Melt pool size and depth are majorly dependent on the energy absorbed by the powder bed when scanned by the laser [28]. Numerous studies have been performed to produce highly dense SLM parts by optimising the process parameters [29-33]. Gibson et al. [27] categorically listed the process parameters which affect the density, and hence the mechanical properties of SLM parts, including the laser power, scan speed, hatch spacing, layer thicknes,and scan strategy. Process parameter optimisation for defect suppression and overallbuild quality in the case of Ti-6Al-4V SLM parts has also been extensively studied [34-37]. There are several studies also focusing on the microstructure and mechanical properties of SLM Ti-6Al-4V parts [38-41]. However, minimal studies have recognised the importance of the size of the features on the quality of these parts; i.e., how the size of a feature can influence the density, microstructure, and mechanical properties of a particular part due to variations in the thermal profile within these features during processing.",

However, the current literature lacks a systematic study which reports on the influence of the size of a sample on the porosity and microstructure of as-built Ti-6Al-4V samples. Further, studies on the impacts of changes in size on the performances of stress-relieved Ti-6Al-4V specimens under tensile loading are scarce. Therefore, the current study aims at filling the research gap by attempting to explore the influence of the \"size of features\" on SLM parts' densities, hardness values, microstructures, and mechanical properties.",

    "content": "The 3D reconstructions of the cross-sectioned samples and their porosity percentages are presented in Figure 2. In the majority of the samples,defects preferentially aligned around the edges of the cross sections. This preferential alignment could be linked to the porosity emerging between the contour scan and core scan regions. This is in agreement with an earlier study by Yang et al. [49] for Al alloys.\n\n![](images/5355a0a4c269c2a23b1359d3fc87c8bcc5319e45f2b947c18b163768d745a011.jpg)  \nFigure 2. Variation of porosity percentage with respect to the size parameters of the samples. C1 had the highest porosity, and ${ \\mathrm { C } } 4$ had the lowest. Error bars in the plot represent the standard deviations of the values.\n\nIn a study by Koutney et al. [42], Al alloy cubes with varying edge lengths were manufactured. The study reported that the porosity in the top plane of the cubes increased from $0 . 0 3 \\%$ to $5 . 9 5 \\%$ on changing the size from 5 to $1 3 \\mathrm { m m }$ , respectively. Analysing the size effect was, however, not the focus of that tudy. In another study by Dong etal.43],an increase inporosity was reported withdecreasing the gauge diameter of AlSil $0 \\mathrm { M g }$ samples; porosity changed from $1 . 8 7 \\%$ to $0 . 1 \\%$ by increasing the gauge diameter from 1 to $5 \\mathrm { m m }$ , respectively. This agrees with our findings supporting the hypothesis that only a specific window of sizes can be manufactured with high density by using a fixed set of parameters. Once beyond this window, the process parameters will require readjustment. Based on the current results, we conclude that there was an increase in porosity with the decrease in sample size. To define an acceptable size window for a particular set of parameters,an extensive set of samples with size variation is required. It was noted that larger samples (C3,C4,and C5)had lesser variations in their porosities; however, smaller samples (C1 and C2) showed much higher density variations.",

    "content": "Upon decreasing the sample size from C5 to C2, porosity increased by nearly $1 2 0 \\%$ . The increasing porosity with size decrease could be atributed to the temperature distribution (thermal profile) intrinsic to the process. Sample C1 is the extreme case with porosity exceeding $4 \\%$ , the defects in C1 being comprised of a mixture of keyhole and lack-of-fusion pores. However,lack-of-fusion defects dominated over the keyhole defects in majority of the cross-sections along allthe orthogonal planes.Lack-of-fusion defects typically correspond to insufficient energy received by the metal powder, limiting the melting and fusion of layers and resulting in pores/voids with unsintered powder trapped inside the pores [23]. The high number of lack-of-fusion defects in C1can be atributed to the fewer number of scan tracks as the size decreased, which might have led to insuficient energy inputs, resulting in poor melting and fusion of the powder.",

    "content": "To confirm this hypothesis, we trialld four sets of process parameters (varying the laser power and exposure time) for C1 samples and analysed the density variation. As shown in Figure 3, upon increasing the laser power (i.e., increasing the energy density), porosity reduced significantly. Unexpectedly, upon reducing the laser power, internal porosity still reduced; however, the surface roughness increased significantly,leading to poor qualitysamples. It was also observed that on fixing the laser power and reducing the scan speed (stillincreasing the energy density using a different approach), porosity improvement was beter than the case of increasing the scan speed. Conclusive proof requires further research on process parameter optimisation with small samples to deal with uncertainties. However, the current results still prove the insufficiency of the input laser energy in the original C1 samples. The study by Sun et al. [50] suggests that Ti-6Al-4V samples possess high density when manufactured using high laser power and low scanning speeds. This statement holds for C1 samples manufactured using a range of process parameters (Figure 3).\n\n![](images/5710abe0ff336ab5debf97febf58804c63f38503bd0cf4aa43c1b5ce7ebd7313.jpg)  \nFigure 3.

    "content": "In terms of the metallurgical properties, studies show that the microstructure of SLM as-built Ti-6Al-4V comprises $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ martensitic phases. The $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ grains “grow within elongated prior $\\beta$ grains, which grow through the deposition of consecutive layers\" [40,51]. In the samples analysed in this study, lateral and frontal planes comprised of fine $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ acicular grains with prior $\\beta$ grain boundaries are visible in the micrographs in Figures 4 and 5. This is in agreement with the literature. $\\beta$ grains had a lenticular morphology, while $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ ones were organized within the prior $\\beta$ grain boundaries [52]. Top planes, on the other hand, revealed cros-sections of the $\\beta$ grains (Figure 4).\n\n$\\beta$ columnar grains were present because solidification of Ti-6Al-4V in SLM takes place in the $\\beta$ phase field, and heat is mainly conducted away vertically [38]. The orientation of $\\beta$ grain boundaries has a high dependence on heat conduction direction when the laser is scanning a layer [40]. Therefore, with the double scanning strategy used in the current study, prior $\\beta$ grain boundary vectors were expected to be parallel to the build direction. This held for the samples in this study, with some misorientations observed in the smallest sample C1 (Figure 5). Thijs et al. [40] reported extreme dependence of the prior $\\beta$ grain boundary's orientation on the scanning pattern, and hence, on the local heat transfer conditions in the powder bed; i.e.,the thermal gradient. Therefore,the misorientations observed in C1 could be attributed to the limited local heat conduction in any particular direction resulting from insufficient energy input, as discussed in case of porosity variation due to change in size.",

    "content": "Figure 6 represents the micro-hardness profile map for samples C1 and C5. Figure 7,on the other hand, shows a plot for the overallhardness variation with respect to the sample size. There was no particular trend in hardness values with the change in size. Considering the error bars, hardness values for all te samples were comparable, and the two extreme samples (C5 and C1) had a rather close average hardness value ( ${ \\approx } 3 8 6 $ HV). This is comparable to the micro-hardness of Ti-6Al-4V reported in the literature, which typically varies between 340 and $5 0 0 \\mathrm { H V }$ [40]. Since the change in the sample size did not have a significant influence on the material's microstructure,the hardness of the material was not affected. This is owing to the nature of hardness as a material property, which mainly corresponds to the microstructure and not necessarily to the defects to a certain extent. It is important to note that the pore fraction in a sample can influence the hardness of a material once it surpasses a critical limit [53,54], which is material dependent. For the case of Ti-6Al-4V within the range investigated in the current study, this was not substantial.\n\n![](images/4529bed971a232bc9fe23c51a8ddacc731dd62ae367435cc6c4b1f1410ada96b.jpg)  \nFigure 6.

    "content": "By decreasing the gauge width of tensile samples from 5 to $1 \\mathrm { m m }$ , tensile stress at yield (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS),and Young's modulus (E) experienced decreases of approximately $1 2 \\%$ $1 5 \\%$ and $1 4 \\%$ , respectively. However, the elongation at break (El) was found to be more sensitive to change in size and decreased by $\\approx 5 7 . 6 \\%$ . The variation in the tensile properties can also be correlated to the amount of porosity in the samples by parallelism [57]and the gauge size [58]. Literature on the latter shows that the use of non-standard tensile test bars does not affect the strength significantly but can influence Young's modulus and the elongation to break. However, the responses of these properties to variations in the gauge size are not consistent and can be material dependent,as demonstrated by these articles: [58,59]. The lowest values of porosity in samples T3-T5 granted them higher tensile properties. As the porosity content almost doubled in sample T2, the tensile properties of the material started deteriorating. An increase in porosity by almost 15 times in sample T1 resulted in the most significant deterioration in properties within the range investigated in this study. This suggests that the size of features had a significant effct on the mechanical properties of parts processed by SLM due to the correlation between the sizes of the features and the amount of porosity forming in the samples during processing using a fixed set of process parameters.",

Overall,fracture surfaces were composed of shallow dimples, cleavage facets, and open pores in both cases, suggesting a combination of brittle and ductile fracturing. The maximum porosity or the region with the most unfused powder particles was where the support structures were created during manufacturing. However, T1 possessed greater porosity than T5 when comparing their porosity regions per overall area of the sample's surface (Figure 9).",

    "content": "Interestingly,in the results reported by Dong etal.[43]for AlSi10Mg samples,strength deterioration due to size variation showed a similar overal trend in the change of mechanical properties due to the change in features size to the case of Ti-6Al-4V samples used in the current study. This suggests that size of features had a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the parts processed by SLM,and that the magnitude of its influence is dependent on the set of optimised SLM parameters used. The current study shows a greater influence of change in size on mechanical properties and microstructure compared to the results reported by Zhao et al. [45]for SLM Ti-6Al-4V samples. Zhao et al. [45] manufactured samples in the form of cylinders which were machined down for testing. Therefore, the results might not wholly be comparable to the case of a sample solely manufactured additively without further machining. This is mainly because the thermal profile would be different in the case of printing small features directly (as has been shown in the current study)from printing large structures and then machining out a smaler feature. The former is more relevant to the AM community, since ultimately, SLM is a net shape manufacturing process. This is clearly supported by the porosity distribution presented in Figure 2, which shows that porosity in the smallest samples was mainly located near the edges of the samples. Had these samples been machined,the results may have been in agreement with what has already been published in the literature due to machining out the defected region. This research willalso be more applicable to areas where using the design freedom in AM is of paramount importance, such as the work on fabricating laticed structures where part machining is difficult or impossible.",

A similar trend was also evident in porosity and microstructure variation in the as-built Ti-6Al-4V samples (C1-C5),as discussed earlier. Since hardness is fundamentally related to the yield strength of a material, the yield strengths of the samples with two extreme feature sizes were expected to be of similar scale in this study, when considering the hardness values of samples presented in Figure 7. Therefore, any variation in mechanical properties of the tensile bars with differences in gauge width can be considered dependent on the defect formation induced due to the change in size and not the material itself.",

    "content": "Thisstudy investigated the influence of feature size on the defect formation, microstructure homogeneity,and mechanical performance of Ti-6Al-4V parts produced by SLM. One of the motives behind this work was to assess the applicability of a fixed set of \"optimised\" process parameters to features of a wide range of sizes. Various parts were manufactured using a fixed set of parameters, originally optimized for $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ samples, as typically done in SLM, while varying the size between 1 and $5 \\mathrm { m m }$ . The results of this study confirmed the dependence of the quality of the samples on their size at a given set of process parameters. As the sample size decreased beyond a certain threshold, porosity increased significantly, resulting in poorer tensile properties (strength and ductility). The yield strength decreased by ${ \\sim } 1 2 \\%$ , ultimate tensile strength by ${ \\sim } 1 5 \\%$ and elongation by $\\sim 5 6 \\%$ , upon decreasing gauge width from 5 to $1 \\mathrm { m m }$ . The effects of the sample size on the microstructure and hardness were, however, negligible. The variation in porosity with sample size was attributed to the significant change in the thermal profile and gradients within the material during processing. Lack-of-fusion defects in the smaller samples was exacerbated by the low energy inputs, and increasing the energy density successfully reduced porosity in these samples. This shows that a tweak in the process parameters is necessary to cope with this phenomenon to ensure the fabrication of parts of reliable structural integrityfor allfeature sizes.Massive efforts in the research community are directed towards optimizing the process parameters for materials to be processed by SLM.",

    "content": "# ABSTRACT\nAlthough numerous reports have elucidated the neurotoxic impacts ofTi-6Al-4V(Ti64) due to the presence of vanadium,itis the most widelyused biomedical Ti material.This is because it exhibits significantlybeter mechanical performance characteristics than thoseof pure Ti. Inaddition to the possibilityoffacilitating the production ofcustomized medicines,selective laser melting (SLM) additive manufacturing (AM) can enable pure Ti to match the properties of Ti64 by utilizing several mechanisms such as grain refinement and solid solution strengthening.These results can be obtained due to the high cooling rate of the AM processand viaapossible modification in the alloy chemistry ofTi. Herein,we reporta novel approach that endows the pure Ti prepared via AM with excellent mechanical properties (ultimate tensile strength,yield strength,elongation,and microhardness of 1057.05 MPa,784.59 MPa, $2 4 . 0 9 \\%$ ,and 307 Hv,respectively),corrosion resistance,and biocompatibility,while significantly reducing the costof the powder.The pure Ti material developed in this study has significant potential for useas an advanced biomedical material in a variety of applications such as dental and bone structure replacement.Furthermore,itcan actas a low-cost alternative to biomedical materials such as Ti-6Al-4V.\n\n$^ { © }$ 2020 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Ltd.This is an open access article under the CCBY license (http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).",

    "content": "Compared to biomedical $3 1 6 \\mathrm { ~ L ~ }$ stainless steel (316 L SS）and vitallium(CoCrMo),Ti and Ti alloys are more suitable for biomedical applications due to their favorable properties such as lower Yong's modulus and hypotoxicity [1-5]. These properties are promising for the utilization of Ti and its alloys in applications such as artificial hip joints, artificial knee joints,bone plates,dental implants,and stents in blood vessels [6].Among the various Ti alloys,biomedical $\\beta$ -typealloys such as Ti-Mo and Ti-Nb-Ta-Zr(TNTZ) alloys are designed to reduce the Young's modulus of Ti-6Al-4V(Ti64) and commercially pure Ti （CPTi)in order to eliminate the so-called stress shielding efect [2]. Unfortunately, many $\\beta$ -type alloys contain expensive and/or high melting point elements such as Mo,Nb,and Ta,limiting their clinical applications.Thus,Ti64 and pure Ti are still the most widely used biomedical Ti-based materials [7].\n\nIt is well-known that Ti64 exhibits a high corrosion resistance and good biocompatibility.However,it may also release vanadium (V) ions and aluminum (Al) ions into the human body [8]. Both these ions have been documented to exert neurotoxic effects on humans and may be associated with Alzheimer's disease,neuropathy, and osteomalacia [9].In contrast,pure Ti not only displays good corrosion resistance and biocompatibility,but also shows better plasticity $( \\sim 3 0 \\% )$ and lower Young's modulus (\\~110 GPa) than those of the Ti64 alloy.Nevertheless,the use of pure Ti in biomedical applications is hindered by its significantly lower strength and hardness than those of Ti64 [10]. Table S1 further provides details about typical biomedical Ti and Ti alloys in terms of their mechanical properties,corrosion resistance,wear resistance,and biocompatibility.",

    "content": "Selective laser melting (SLM) is a common additive manufacturing (AM) technology [11,12]. SLM can be used to produce both bulk and dense Ti materials as well as lattice structures for reducing the modulus mismatch between implants and bone structures [13,14].For instance, Attar et al.[15] prepared CP-Ti parts using SLM with a microhardness of 261 Hv and an ultimate tensile strength of $7 5 7 \\mathrm { M P a }$ In comparison, Choi et al.[16] fabricated CP-Ti by using electron beam melting (EBM),another mainstream AM technology; the obtained specimens exhibited an ultimate tensile strength of 711 MPa and a yield strength of 661 MPa.From another EBM report, the as-prepared CP-Ti showed microhardness at ${ \\sim } 1 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { H v }$ [17]. Comparing between SLM and EBM, the latter is more capable to process high melting point materials and/ or brittle materials due to the associated high beam power and low residual stress [18].The precision of EBM,however,is often lower than SLM due to a few factors,including coarser powder material to be used and a larger beam size [18].To process CP-Ti and Ti-6Al-4V, SLM is the most desirable AM approach for the associated better geometry accuracy, surface quality and overall mechanical performance [18].\n\nAlthough the aforementioned SLM-prepared CP-Ti shows superior mechanical properties than those of the conventionally fabricated CPTi,its mechanical properties are still lower than those of Ti64.Thus, improving the CP-Ti performance is a challenging but rewarding task. The successful development of CP-Ti with the necessary high mechanical performance will enable the replacement of Ti64 with CP-Ti ina wide range of biomedical and/or structural applications.",

    "content": "While the strength ofCP-Ti is low,its ductility is signifcantly higher than that of Ti64,with ultra-pure Ti showing an elongation of up to $65 \\%$ [19]. Such high ductility leaves a large space for the strength-ductility trade-off, implying that it may be possible to produce CP-Ti with superior strength by slightly reducing its ductility.Such a change in the mechanical properties of pure Ti may be achieved by exploiting the solid strengthening effect of oxygen,which is a powerful and convenient approach for strengthening Ti-based materials [20].\n\nBased on the above-mentioned rationale,we investigated the use of SLM in this study for the development of pure Ti with superior properties; this was aimed at replacing Ti64as a biomedical Ti material, based on the following pathway:\n\na.Modify a hydrogenated-dehydrogenated Ti (HDH-Ti) powder with a high oxygen content (\\~ O.3 wt.% oxygen) and render it printable.   \nb.Print HDH-Ti into a dense bulk material.   \nc.Realize the solution hardening potential of the HDH-Ti and improve its mechanical properties to match those of Ti64.   \nd.Demonstrate that the developed material exhibits a high mechanical performance,biocompatibility,and low cost, enabling it to compete with Ti64.\n\nThe particles of the HDH-Ti powder used in this study are nonspherical, rendering its direct printing using SLM difficult if not impossible. Irregularly shaped powders do not flow easily and tend to be mechanically interlocked and entangled with each other,thereby hindering their flow on the powder bed.However,our recent research found that it is possible to modify the low-cost HDH-Ti powder into a spherical, printable Ti powder using a dedicated mechanical ball milling process [21,22]. Compared to the atomized Ti powder,the preparation of the HDH-Ti powder is significantly simpler,rendering it a highly cost-competitive material.",

    "content": "Another important contribution to enhancing mechanical properties is provided by the solid solution strengthening effect of the interstitial elements in the matrix.Due to the use of diferent preparation methods, the oxygen (O) content of HDH-Ti powders is higher than that of the GA-Ti powders [39]. Table 3 lists the chemical composition of the HDH-Ti powder,as-printed HDH-Ti and as-printed GA-Ti samples. It Was found that the oxygen content of the HDH-Ti powder is equivalent to that of the ASTMGrade 3 Ti [26]. Interstitial oxygen has a significant influence on the movement of dislocations and can give rise to an energy shielding effect on the dislocations,which is called “solid solution strengthening\"[40]. Solid-dissolved oxygen and Ti have very strong chemical bonds,increasing the strength relative to that of pure Ti while maintaining good plasticity [41,42]. Moreover,oxygen atoms can give rise to the strong pinning of the highly mobile screw dislocations, preventing the further gliding of the dislocations [12,37].The oxygen solid solution strengthening effect, $\\Delta { \\sigma } _ { Y S }$ where $\\sigma _ { Y S }$ means the yield strength,was evaluated according to the Labusch model [43,44]:\n\n![](images/59d379ba319c3735775cb48212bd0211f8ed18f86810b1da28262d31e980bec6.jpg)\n\n![](images/c349a59749dc3c1e4e8cca4d0b727254dcc20852a349b3cfd04b999e392d04ed.jpg)  \ne (d) phase angle with the inset showing the equivalent circuit model.\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma _ { 0 . 2 \\% \\mathrm { Y } S } = \\frac { \\tau _ { 0 } } { S _ { F } } = \\frac { 1 } { S _ { F } } \\left( \\frac { F _ { m } ^ { 4 } c ^ { 2 } w } { 4 G b ^ { 9 } } \\right) ^ { \\frac { 1 } { 3 } }\n$$",

For passive metals such as Ti and Ti alloys,finer grains have a higher grain boundary volume fraction and can provide a higher number of active atoms.This enhances the ability of the material to form a passivating film on its surface,thereby improving the corrosion resistance of the material [45-48].Balyanov et al. [49] compared the corrosion resistance of ultrafine-grained and coarse-grained CP-Ti samples and found that the ultrafine-grained CP-Ti samples have better corrosion resistance than coarse-grained CP-Ti because ultrafine-grained CP-Ti is prone to rapid passivation.

    "content": "For long-term use in the human body,metal implants not only require superior biocompatibility,but also must bear the effects of various forces such as extrusion, torsion,and bending.To obtain implants with good mechanical compatibility, the implant material must have sufficient strength and low elastic modulus,and to provide good mechanical support for and match with the hard tissue [51]. Generally speaking,Ti materials are not with high wear resistance [52]. In the case of total hip implants,conical inserts on femoral stems are often made of CoCrMo alloys or Ti alloys such as Ti-6Al-4V; inserts' head can be made of Co-based alloys, $\\mathsf { A l } _ { 2 } \\mathsf { O } _ { 3 }$ or $Z \\mathrm { { r } } 0 _ { 2 }$ [2]. In this study,we found that the as-printed HDH-Ti samples are close or even better than the mechanical properties of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy that used for surgical implants (ASTM F1108-14).Meanwhile,hardness of the as-printed HDH-Ti is\\~310 Hv,close to that of the CoCrMo alloy,which is a material of high wear resistance [52]. Therefore,the currently developed lowcost,as-printed HDH-Ti has the potential to be used in hip or knee joint applications.The elastic modulus values of Ti and Ti alloys used in clinical applications are in the 75-125 GPa range and their compressive strength values are in the range of 480-1100 MPa [53].While this is sufficient to meet the requirements of clinical use,the elastic modulus of these metals is still high and does not match the elastic modulus values of human cancellous bone,cortical bone,and teeth.Therefore, increasing research attention has been directed to the design of Ti alloys (e.g. low modulus $\\beta$ Ti alloys and lattices） with improved mechanical compatibility with human bone.We summarize the mechanical properties of the relevant additively manufactured medical Ti alloys in Fig.11 [3,54-63].",

The mechanical properties of the as-printed HDH-Ti samples in this study meet the requirements even though the elastic modulus is slightly higher than that of the GA-Ti used in clinical applications.Moreover, if necessary,for clinical applications,the elastic modulus of the asprinted HDH-Ti can also be reduced through the design of porous lattice structures.\n\nTable 1 Corrosion parameters of the as-printed HDH-Ti and GA-Ti in a $3 . 5 \\%$ NaCl solution.   \n\n<table><tr><td>Sample</td><td>Corrosion potential,Eorr (mV)</td><td>Corrosioncurrentdensity, orr (μ/m-2)</td><td>Corrosion rate, micron per year,(μm/y)</td></tr><tr><td>HDH-Ti</td><td>-287.51</td><td>1.96</td><td>17.15</td></tr><tr><td>CP-Ti</td><td>-252.41</td><td>3.07</td><td>26.85</td></tr></table>\n\nTable 2 Fitting results of the EIS spectra for the as-printed HDH-Ti and GA-Ti samples in a $3 . 5 \\%$ NaCl solution.   \n\n<table><tr><td>Sample</td><td>Rr(kΩ cm2)</td><td>CPE1 × 10-6(Ω-1cm² sn)</td><td>n1</td><td>Rct (kΩ cm²)</td><td>CPEdi × 10-6(0-1cm² s-n)</td><td>n2</td><td>x×10-4</td></tr><tr><td>HDH-Ti</td><td>669</td><td>0.398</td><td>0.800</td><td>378</td><td>2.407</td><td>0.996</td><td>0.13</td></tr><tr><td>GA-Ti</td><td>77</td><td>1.094</td><td>0.705</td><td>645</td><td>0.212</td><td>0.838</td><td>8.41</td></tr></table>",

Surface proteins can transform information (topology, chemical properties,etc.） provided by the implant surface into biological signals.More profound understanding of the biological reponse to the implant surface by human cells can be found in related studies [66-68].In addition, the cells respond to the generated biological signals and achieve stable adhesion,which in turn affects cell proliferation and differentiation [69,7O].The wettability of a material is also an important factor affecting the interaction between the material and the cells.Previous studies have shown that good wetting properties of materials effectively promote cell surface protein adhesion and cell adhesion [71-73].\n\nTable 3 Chemical compositions of HDH-Ti powder, GA-Ti powder,as-printed HDH-Ti samples and as-printed GA-Ti samples.

Based on the initial cell adhesion and cell proliferation results,the as-printed HDH-Ti samples also showed better biocompatibility,which is consistent with the above results.In addition, the initial cell adhesion and cell proliferation (24 h) results indicate that the wettability of the two materials at fist has only a slightly beneficial effect on the cells.However,the promotion of cell growth by the good wettability was gradually amplified with the extension of the cellculture time (72 h and $1 2 0 \\mathrm { h }$ ),and became highly significant.\n\n![](images/4085e055421c1e15fc272eb85da4d6b2f925277478a3da1744bc8189655199ca.jpg)  \nFig.12.Surfaceroughness3Dviewsandcontactangle imagesof(a,c)as-printedHDH-Tisampleand(b,d)as-printedGA-Tisample.",

The price of HDH-Ti powders is only one-seventh of that of the traditional GA-Ti powders.While the prices of the powders may vary in different countries or regions,the overall trend of the much lower price of HDH-Ti is valid in all cases. In addition,ball milling for the powder modification is a routine laboratory technology and the milling time is not long(e.g.4 h), inducing only a small additional cost to the powder modification approach developed in this study.The combination of such a low price and the mechanical properties and biocompatibility demonstrated for the as-printed HDHTi samples indicates that the use of HDH-Ti powders in biomedical materials is highly advantageous.",

Conclusions\nIn this work,a low-cost spherical HDH-Ti powder was developed by powder modification.The relative density,microstructure,mechanical properties,electrochemical properties,and in vitro biocompatibility of the as-printed samples were studied.The main conclusions are as follows:\n\n（1）Using the method of mechanical ball milling,the non-spherical HDH-Ti powder was modified into a printable spherical CP-Ti powder.By adjusting printing parameters,the relative density of the as-printed HDH-Ti samples of greater than $9 9 . 5 \\%$ was achieved.Micro-CT examination found that the interior of the as-printed samples contained randomly distributed pores with a size of less than $5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$   \n(2）The XRD,SEM,and TEM analyses of the as-printed HDH-Ti samples revealed that they have the hcp crystal structure of Ti,and the modified powder produces micro-strain.In addition,dislocations,stacking faults,and sub-grain boundaries were found near the cross-section.   \n(3）The as-printed HDH-Ti samples display high ultimate tensile strength $( 1 0 5 7 . 0 5 \\ \\mathrm { \\ M P a } \\ \\pm \\ 2 9 . 1 4 \\ \\mathrm { \\ M P a } )$ and yield strength $( 7 8 4 . 5 9 \\mathrm { M P a } \\pm 3 3 . 2 5 \\mathrm { M P a } )$ , good elongation $( 2 4 . 0 9 \\% \\pm 1 . 8 1 \\% )$ _， and microhardness of $3 0 7 . 6 \\pm 2 . 5 7 \\ : \\mathrm { H v } .$   \n(4） The electrochemical performance test found that the as-printed HDH-Ti samples display a lower corrosion current density $\\left( I _ { c o r r } \\right)$ ,improved corrosion potential $( E _ { c o r r } )$ ,and lower corrosion rate than the as-printed GA-Ti samples.   \n(5）The in vitro biocompatibility test showed that the as-printed HDH-Ti samples have better biocompatibility than the asprinted GA-Ti samples.\n\n# Declaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.",

    "content": "# Introduction\nAdditive manufacturing promises to revolutionize the fabrication process of structural components in several industries. The layer-by-layer fabrication process results in a wide design-space with the freedom to create complex geometries and, more importantly, the ability to have direct localized control of the thermal history. There is an intimate relationship between the thermal history and the resulting microstructure [1],such that tailored, or even functionally graded, microstructures may be realized through additive manufacturing [2]. For example, in areas where high strength and resistance to fatigue crack initiation (FCI) is required,high cooling rates may be beneficial to produce finer microstructures. On the other hand,as larger grains are beneficial for areas where crack growth is critical, a reduction in the cooling rate can lead to a coarsening of the microstructure [3].\n\nThe extension of additive manufacturing to fatigue critical applications has been hindered by processinduced defects such as lack-of-fusion (LoF)， gas entrapped pores,and surface roughness [4-6]. Defects act as stress concentrators inducing early FCI, severely limiting the potential for producing reliable,fatigue resistant additive manufactured (AM) parts. This study aims to better understand process-structure-property relationships as they relate to the fatigue performance of laser beam-powder bed fusion (LB-PBF） 304L stainless steel (304LSS). The majority of research efforts regarding AM parts have focused on understanding the structure-property relationships as they are related to processed induced defects [7-11]. This work instead focuses on materials that are less sensitive to defects to elicit the microstructure's role in FCI of AM materials. The results presented in this study give early insight into the true potential of additive manufacturing to produce targeted microstructure for application-specific desired properties.",

    "content": "Austenitic stainless steels (SSs) in their wrought form are known to be more susceptible to FCI at annealing twin boundaries (∑3-TB) and high angle grain boundaries (HAGB) than nano/micro-scale defects such as intermetallic inclusions and voids [12-15]. The deformation behaviour at $\\Sigma 3$ -TB and HAGB has been shown to result in both elastic and plastic incompatibilities across the boundary [13-20].For low applied stresses, such as those in the high-cycle fatigue (HCF) regime, the small differences in elastic deformation near $\\Sigma 3$ -TBs result in elastic mismatches across the boundaries.The increased localized stresses promote FCI along the boundary which can be exacerbated when higher loads are applied, expediting the crack formation. Additionally, HAGB are also capable of promoting FCI in wrought austenitic SSs as dislocations are not easily transferred across the grain boundary. As these dislocations pile up,edge dislocations of different signs attract each other resulting in the accumulation of vacancies and the formation of micro-cracks [21].\n\nWhile microstructural features such as $\\Sigma 3$ -TB/HABG are difficult to avoid in the manufacturing of wrought materials,additive manufacturing provides a means to produce net shaped/near-net shaped parts without the need for post-processing steps such as forming and /solution annealing. Austenitic SSs exhibit exceptional toughness and have been successfully implemented in LB-PBF processes [22,23].",

    "content": "The stress-life fatigue data and corresponding Basquin curves shown in Figure 3(c) remarkably indicates the LBPBF(304LSS) has improved stress-life fatigue resistance across all stress levels. The fatigue life of LB-PBF material for any given stress amplitude was one-two orders of magnitude longer than the wrought material. While most AM materials fail under cyclic loading due to the presence of process-induced defects [6,9,31,32], the majority of the dominating cracks in the LB-PBF(304LSS) specimens initiate at the surface without the presence of defects. Figure 4 details two fracture surfaces from (a) strain control test at $\\epsilon _ { \\mathrm { a } } = 0 . 3 \\%$ and (b） force control test at $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { a } } = 4 0 0 \\mathrm { M P a }$ . In both cases a dominant crack initiates at the surface (indicated by arrow-1） without any indication of the presence of defects then coalesces with a smaller crack which shows evidence of FCI at a defect (indicated by arrow-2). Surprisingly, in these cases and for many other specimens,the dominant crack did not initiate from a defect suggesting that microstructural features are responsible for crack initiation.\n\nThe dominating effects of microstructure rather than defects occur despite the defect sizes being much larger than the average microstructure size. Previous works have shown improved fatigue performance of AM titanium alloys after HIP related to defect sizes being smaller than the grains [33-35]. For the present study, however, no HIP was performed and defects present in the material were much larger than the grain size,as indicated by Figure 4.",

    "content": "Considering the majority of the fatigue life in HCF regime is spent in nucleating a crack, the observed differences in the 304LSS microstructural features,are most likely responsible for the improved HCF behaviour. Under strain-controlled conditions,the similar HCF behaviour between wrought and LB-PBF 304LSS can be explained by the deformation being limited by the utilized control mode. Contrastingly, under forcecontrolled conditions,the deformation for the LB-PBF material with a higher cyclic yield strength would be expected to be less severe than the wrought counterpart. The lower cyclic deformation leads to improved fatigue resistance for the LB-PBF(304LSS).\n\nThe ex-situ CIS results for both the wrought and LB-PBF material at the stress amplitude of $3 3 0 \\mathrm { M P a }$ are shown in Figure 5 with their corresponding inverse pole figure (IPF) orientation overlays.The crack for the wrought material (Figure 5(a)) developed into a dominant crack approximately $3 1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ long by 35,000 cycles, while the longest crack observed in the LB-PBF material (Figure 5(c)) was stillin the initiation stage at $7 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ long by 100,oo0 cycles.The overlays of the EBSD orientation data on the LB-PBF cracks in Figure 5 show the relationship between the crack and underlying microstructure.

The nature of FCI in 304LSS and the unique microstructure for LB-PBF 304LSS, lead to a reduction in $\\Sigma 3$ -TB, shifting the dominant FCI mechanism of the LB-PBF(304LSS) to HAGB.More importantly,the higher cyclic yield strength of LB-PBF(304LSS) results in much less cyclic deformation,even at stress amplitudes approaching the quasi-static yield stress. This is noticeable in Figure 4,where the slip lines,that are easily distinguishable in Figure 4(a) for the wrought material, are mostly absent in Figure $^ { 4 ( \\mathrm { b } , \\mathrm { c } ) }$ for the LBPBF material. This combination of finer microstructure and lower HAGB/ $\\Sigma 3$ -TB density results in the improved fatigue performance for LB-PBF(304LSS) compared to its wrought counterpart.\n\n![](images/9f2413f625e25e0f6a15bb1c07a4fd5559a68e0ea051bfd7b9ca772c4de5cc85.jpg)  \nFigure5.(a)EMimageofadominantcrackinthewroughtmaterialwiththegrainstructureoverlay(b)SEMmageofa£3-TBboundary crackinLB-PBFmateriawiththegrainstructureoverlayand(c)SEMmageofaHAGBcrackinB-PBFmaterialwiththegrainstrcture overlay.",

    "content": "# Conclusions\nThese profound results show that while most AM materials are susceptible to early fatigue failures,austenitic SSs can be successfully fabricated via LB-PBF to offer superior strength,ductility, and fatigue resistance compared to their wrought counterparts. Taking advantage of the intimate relationships among the localized thermal input during the AM process and the resulting microstructure and mechanical properties,the fatigue performance was improved by avoiding the typical FCI mechanisms associated with the wrought counterpart.\n\nThese findings for LB-PBF(304LSS) offer early insight into how additive manufacturing can be used to fabricate superior fatigue resistant materials by further establishing the process-structure-property-performance relationships and taking advantage of the increased designspace.By leveraging the intimate relationship between local thermal input and the resulting microstructure/properties it may be possible to tailor microstructure to meet specific loading requirements. The ability to fabricate AM materials with increased resistance to crack initiation and/or growth can expedite the adoption of this technology for fatigue critical applications across many industrial sectors to deliver lighter, stronger, and safer products.\n\nIt is important to note that the internal porosity is also influenced by the thermal history and deviations outside of an optimal process window could result in defects dominating the fatigue behaviour despite the improved microstructure.More in-depth studies focusing on various process/post-process effects on the resulting microstructure,dislocation density,and deformation characteristics are needed to fully establish the processstructure-property relationships for LB-PBF(304LSS).\n\n# Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n\n# Funding\nPartial funding for this work was provided by the National Science Foundation under grant number l657195.",

    "content": "Metal additive manufacturing (AM) is a new manufacturing paradigm that has recently experienced rapid growth,in part due to its ability to produce parts with complex geometries from increasingly diverse materials with minimal tooling. Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is one of the more common metal AM processes in which metallic particles ina powder bed are selectively fused usinga high power laser. LPBF is a complex process that involves laser-material interaction, extreme thermal gradients and cooling rates,melt pool fluid flow, temperature-dependent surface tension effects,and gas-phase fluid dynamics resulting from the rapid evaporation of metal.These effects and phenomena dictate the stability of the melt pool (interface between the laser and powder particles) during the micro-welding process,which in turn drives final part microstructure and properties.A particular phenomenon of interest recently reported in LPBF is powder denudation [1],defined as the redistribution of metal powder due to its interaction with the induced flow of the ambient atmosphere caused by a jet of metal vapor from the melt pool.Denudation, first mentioned in fundamental studies of single track formation [2],has been the subject of several experimental investigations and is key to understanding the dynamics of the LPBF melt pool environment. In addition to drawing powder particles into the melt pool [3],denudation also results in the creation of oxidized spatter [4] due to a portion of the denuded powder particles melting mid-flight upon interaction with the hot vapor plume and incident or scattered light.These airborne particles exit the laser interaction region [5] and can then result in lack of fusion porosity sites due to shielding underlying powder particles from laser irradiation [9]. Modeling of denudation,however,has yetto be fully realized in order to match the experimental findings.",

    "content": "Finite element models that are capable of modeling the two-phase flow with appropriate particle contact mechanics are only starting to emerge [1O].Some previous works have also modeled the vapor plume during welding [11].Despite these studies, prediction of the extent of denudation under arbitrary process conditions has yet to be accomplished.\n\nThe denudation process can produce unfavorable effects to successive melt tracks and layers which should be minimized. Recent modeling work has shown that denudation in the LPBF process is potentially responsible for generating spatter from large powder clumps obstructing the path of the laser.This obstruction can cause microporosity by creating a transient cold spot in the melt pool [12].This also can create further spatter when the laser is no longer interrupted,as the sudden increase in laser intensity in the melt pool causes a sudden increase in melt pool depth.This increase in depth then creates a jet of metal behind the melt pool known as back spatter.At the same time,the clump of powder which originally obstructed the beam is rapidly melted and ejected,leading to further spatter.Although denudation can also be seen as a mechanism of mass transport into the melt pool, transport does not occur uniformly:initial weld tracks in a given area draw in powder particles from both sides of the weld due to denudation. Subsequent welds,however,draw in powder from only one side,causing uneven deposition of material and resulting in the tracks adjacent to the initial track having less volume.This effect necessitates hatch distances that minimize the uneven deposition [2],where hatch distance is defined as the distance between two successive laser tracks within the same layer. The non-uniform mass transport mechanism also limits the theoretical minimum feature size achievable,since it draws excess powder into the melt pool in addition to the powder directly in the path of the process laser,increasing the diameter of the weld track.",

    "content": "One approach to reduce the effects of powder redistribution due to denudation has been reported in another metal AM process:electron beam melting (EBM).EBM is a powder bed fusion metal AM process that shares some similarities with LPBF,with the primary difference being the use of an electron beam instead of a laser as the energy source for welding.In EBM,a method of powder pre-heating is used to prevent powder redistribution due to coulombic repulsion arising from charge buildup on powder particles.Pre-heating forms small necks between powder particles to prevent this repulsion,which can cause a diffuse cloud of electrostatically suspended particles in the EBMbuild chamber if not sintered a priori. It is typically implemented with volumetric energy densities ranging between 4.12 and $8 . 2 2 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m ^ { 3 } }$ to the weld area prior to melting [13,l4]．Although pre-heating has demonstrated reasonable success in EBM processes,to our knowledge no previous studies have been conducted to investigate using a laser beam to achieve it in LPBF.A pre-heating process for LPBF that reduces denudation has the potential to minimize the complicating effects of the interaction between the vapor plume and the powder bed.It could also lead to a more stable melt pool environment with fewer active mechanisms for defect formation.This is depicted through a simplified illustration shown in Fig.1,where the redistribution of powder is nullified by growing small necks between the particles in the powder bed.",

    "content": "The focus of the current work is to reduce powder redistribution due to denudation in LBPF processes through laser pre-sintering (LPS) similar to EBM pre-heating.LPS investigated in the current work is different from previous literature studies using laser sintering to fabricate near-full density parts [15,16].More specifically,LPS proposed here aims to find a threshold degree of necking between the particles through sintering in the powder bed such that they are restrained from entrainment in the induced flow during the subsequent welding step. This is achieved by reducing the velocity of the laser beam on the powder bed and increasing the laser beam diameter,achieving both longer dwell times and lower laser irradiances needed for the diffusion-mediated LPS process.We note there is a delicate balance between restraining the powder particles but not pre-sintering them to a degree that makes it dificult to separate the finished part from the pre-sintered powder bed.\n\nThe key contribution of the current work is providing a first investigation of the efficacy of using LPS as a denudation reduction technique in LPBF.We study the effect of LPS on powder layer roughness after presintering,and post-LPS denudation using high-fidelity structured light microscopy.A demonstration of pre-sintering effectively reducing the number of airborne particles is made using high-speed video,while SEM imaging of pre-sintered beds elucidates the role of satellite particles in accelerating sintering.An estimation of the forces acting on particles is made to determine the threshold of neck radii required for denudation reduction using analytical expressions.The results of these investigations offer a multi-view understanding of considerations for the eventual implementation of LPS into practical use.",

    "content": "In order to probe the LPS process,single track experiments were carried out to investigate denudation reduction upon implementing LPs as well as other effects related to it.These experiments were carried out in a two-step procedure: a pre-sintering step followed by a welding step. In the pre-sintering step,separate $4 \\mathrm { m m }$ long single tracks of presintering were executed on a small test plate of Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64) with a single layer of gas atomized Ti64 powder from Carpenter Technology Corporation (Formetly LPW Technology Ltd) using a $1 0 7 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ ，600W fiber laser model JK6oOFL by JK Lasers.The powder had $d 5 0$ and $d 5 0$ of $3 2 . 0 2 \\mu m$ and $4 8 . 0 3 \\ : \\mu m .$ ,respectively,and a mean particle size of 32.71 $\\mu m$ ，The full powder particle size distribution is available in the supplementary information. The laser volumetric energy density (VED) applied to each track was varied by applying multiple passes of a presintering beam of known energy density. The laser volumetric energy density (VED) was used as a measure of energy density,and is defined as $\\psi = P / \\nu t w$ where P is the laser power in watts,v is the laser spot velocity,tis the powder layer thickness,and w is the width of the laser beam at focus defined by the $1 / e ^ { 2 }$ diameter as measured and verified by two systems.The first system uses a Point Grey Chameleon (FLIR Systems,Oregon,USA) CCD camera to take images of the beam then the beam diameter is calculated using MATLAB. The second system is an SP920s beam profiler (Ophir-Spiricon,LLC,Utah,USA)．VED was deemed as an acceptable aggregate parameter to use in the current study as the LPS process stays below the melting temperature [17].Since entrainment forces occur not only in the immediate vicinity of the melt pool, but in an area approximately $2 0 0 \\mu m$ on either side of the melt pool [11],the LPS laser was defocused to generate a laser diameter of 1000 $\\mu m$ during the LPS step.",

The reduction in entrainment is expected to decrease spatter and microporosity from beam eclipses as well,as predicted by computational pre-sintering studies [12].Considering this,pre-sintering should reduce the likelihood of a number of defects by the reduction in denudation and thus improve the quality of LPBF parts.The reduction in denudation also will make the LPBF process more efficient, as the powder that was originally meant to be welded is not redistributed to the rest of the bed.The powder should also be useful for more printing cycles,as oxidation and spatter combination during denudation,which become unusable powder waste,will be minimized.",

Some deformation of the larger particles is also seen,though it is difficult to attribute this to the LPS treatment,as particles can stick together in the gas atomization process.Were these satellite particles not a fortuitous consequence of the gas atomization process,LPS may not have beenable to prevent denudation at such low energy densities.This effect has also been found in the EBM pre-heating literature [14],but this is the first mention of the same effect in a laser pre-sintering process.",

    "content": "# 4.5.Comparison of EBM preheating and LPS\nIt is interesting to highlight differences between pre-heating in EBM versus LPBF.First, EBM is performed in vacuum whereas LPBF is performed in inert atmosphere,typically argon.This vacuum environment insulates the powder bed causing it to retain heat longer.This extends elevated temperatures in the bed and thus should widen the processing window for the sintering diffusion process.The gaseous environment also allows the chance for competing oxidation,which needs to be minimized to allow pre-sintering to be successful.EBM also allows for much faster scanning speeds,upwards of $1 4 , 0 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ because beam movement is controlled through magnetic coils.LPBF systems,on the other hand,use scanning mirrors which limit maximum scan speeds to approximately $3 0 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ .While EBM systems are capable of simultaneously heating large areas of powder through rapid rastering of the beam,an LPBF system can only achieve this in a point-wise fashion in single tracks. Perhaps most importantly,in LPBF laser heating only occurs at the surfaces of the powder particles and substrate,whereas the electron beam in EBMcan be considered a volumetric heat source on the scale of a full single layer of powder [22].This effect may explain the lower threshold for LPS by localizing the energy deposition on the surfaces that link particles together.These differences distinguish the two processes as separate,though they are quite similar.Images of preheated beds are reprinted for comparison in Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Information.\n\n# 5.Estimation of entrainment threshold and minimum neck radius\n",

    "content": "The stress distribution in these necks is difficult to estimate,as the powder bed is randomly ordered. To move forward, the assumption is made that the powder bed is monodisperse,with the number of contacts equal to the number found by earlier numerical simulation works [28] at a boundary，which is close to 6.To prevent the need to perform exhaustive monte carlo calculations,it is assumed that these necks are evenly distributed about the hemispherical region.The shape that most evenly distributes these is the lower half of a triaugmented triangular prism,with three equatorial contacts evenly distributed about waist of the particle,and three contacts evenly distributed lower on the particle [29].This configuration is visible in Fig.6a.To evaluate the stresses on the necks,the necks were assumed to be composed of the solid alloy and break at the yield stress.This is intended to capture the brittleness of the sintered necks,which have a single grain boundary bisecting the connection between the two particles.The lift force is assumed to be evenly distributed to each neck,which is offset by the vertical components of the contact adhesion forces $\\begin{array} { r } { F _ { c } = - \\sum _ { n e c k s } { 4 \\pi \\gamma a c o s ( \\phi _ { n e c k } ) } } \\end{array}$ where $\\gamma$ is the surface energy of Ti64 powder,previously measured to be 0.1 $m J / m ^ { 2 }$ for realistic Ti64 surfaces [3O],and $\\phi _ { n e c k }$ is the angle between the normal vector of the neck and the $\\mathbf { z }$ axis.Gravitational forces on the powder particles are assumed to be negligible.In the case where pre-sintering has been applied and necks have formed,the stress is assumed to be evenly distributed to all necks.The equatorial necks are assumed to break at the Von Mises yield criterion, $\\tau _ { u p p e r } > \\sqrt { 3 } \\sigma _ { y i e l d }$ .These upper necks,existing in pure shear,would break first,owing to the lower yield strength of Ti64 in shear as opposed to tension.",

    "content": "Although this analysis yields a reasonable estimate for the LPS threshold,more detailed modeling of LPS for arbitrary powders presents several hurdles that need to be overcome.Powder bed warping and postLPS denudation need to be further studied to determine LPS settings that minimize these effects to prevent this new process improvement from creating more defects than it solves.The warping of a of realistic, polydisperse LPBF powder bed with random packing is difficult to predict analytically,and will likely require more involved numerical approaches.Full, complete simulation of the LPS process is a challenging multi-scale problem,as the parameters and phenomena that determine the final effectiveness are likely to include microscale aspects like geometry of the powder,the size and distribution of satellite particles on the powder,the initial dispersion of powder particle sizes,and the thermal history of the powder and its subsequent oxidation state,as well as the strength of the formed sintered necks.The chemistry of the powder may also limit this technique to certain materials that can sinter in an argon atmosphere. Ss316L, for example,is a common engineering alloy that usually only sinters well in hydrogen atmospheres.Finally,the meso-scale geometry of the powder bed and welding parameters thatare used will contribute as to the forces encountered at the bed surface,since random deviations from a planar bed might increase drag.This increased drag might increase the forces on the particles at that point, and particles entrained there could create a deeper defect. It could be possible that this could initiate a cascade of entrainment from a single bed defect,and require larger necks to prevent denudation.LPS also can change the angle of the laser plume,as demonstrated in Fig.",

    "content": "Experimental characterization and qualification of the process would need to accompany modeling to develop a robust LPS process. Statistical data for bed warpage and post-LPS denudation over a range of process conditions and materials could be done to determine suitable parameters for a range of denudation-prone alloys.The cause of the post-LPs denudation regions could also be aggravated by many factors not covered in this initial experimental probing,and could be investigated. Forinstance,in thicker powder beds where VED is not evenly distributed through the depth,necks may not be able to form to the previous welded layer.The entire sintered powder bed may then be lifted off by the induced flow,which occurred twice in the experiments in this work even with a minimal bed thickness,even though this minimal bed should provide the best process conditions for necks to be formed between the bed and substrate.Experimental work to analyze the cause of the increase in post-LPS denudation with VED would need a more efficient method of probing the network of formed necks that does not disturb the delicate LPS powder bed.Furthermore,LPS has been shown to create a novel melt pool environment that may need different weld parameters to produce successful, continuous weld tracks.Different scan strategies may be the answer to controlling the wetting of the powder bed on the pre-sintered walls of the weld track.From the range and number of potential studies to explore from using LPS to simply eliminate powder redistribution it is clear that slight changes in the dynamics of the melt pool lead to highly different LPBF process states.",

    "content": "Abstract: This paper proposes analytical modeling methods for the prediction of balling,lack-offusion and keyholing thresholds in the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing. The molten pool dimensions were first predicted by a closed-form analytical thermal model. The effects of laser power input, boundary heat loss, powder size distribution and powder packing pattern were considered in the calculation process. The predicted molten pool dimensions were then employed in the calculation of analytical thresholds for these defects.Reported experimental data with different materials were compared to predictions to validate the presented analytical models. The predicted thresholds of these defects under various process conditions have good agreement with the experimental results. The computation time for the presented models is less than 5 min on a personal computer. The optimized process window for Ti6Al4V was obtained based on the analytical predictions of these defects.The sensitivity analyses of the value of threshold to the laser power and scanning speed were also conducted. The proposed analytical methods show higher computational efficiency than finite element methods, without including any iteration-based computations. The aceptable predictive accuracy and low computational time wil make the proposed analytical strategy be a good tool for the optimization of process conditions for the fabrication of defects-free complex products in laser powder bed fusion.\n\nKeywords: analytical prediction; boundary heat transfer; powder size distribution; lack of fusion; balling behavior; keyholing defect",

    "content": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing has been proved to have superior advantages in fabricating products with complex geometries when compared with traditional manufacturing techniques [1,2]. However, the defects occurring in the additive manufacturing process have serious detrimental effects on the quality of the final products and will limit the wide application of this kind of manufacturing technique [3,4]. Thus, good prediction methods for the occurrence of the defects willbe very helpful to figure out the suitable process conditions to fabricate products without defects. Lack-of-fusion is a common defect in LPBF which is induced by incomplete melting of powders and incomplete overlap of adjacent molten pools [5,6], which willfinally lead to lack-of-fusion porosity in products. Balling behavior is another kind of defect which is mainly caused by the poor weting between solidified molten pools and the solid substrate, which will lead to unstable and discontinuous melting tracks [7,8]. Severe balling defect can cause high surface roughness and porosity in the final products. Keyholing behavior is a defect occurring under very high laser energy-density regime. It is related to the evaporation of components in molten material, which wil produce gas in the molten pool. Some gas may be trapped by the solidification front of the molten pool, which willead to high porosity in the final product [1,9]. This paper focuses on the prediction of the generation of the three kinds of defects in laser powder bed fusion.",

Second, the powder bed is assumed to have the maximum packing density in the manufacturing process. Third, this approach calculates the packing porosity in a 2D domain.

The calculated results are shown in Tables 1 and 2,which is $1 1 0 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ for Ti6Al4V and $1 6 0 \\mathrm { J } / \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ for Inconel 718. To validate the prediction accuracy of the proposed analytical methods, the predicted thresholds were compared with experimental measurements, as shown in Figure 5. The predicted results have good agreements with experimental data for the two materials.\n\nTable 2. Results of lack-of-fusion and keyholing for Inconel 718 [28].   ",

    "content": "In this paper, analytical modeling methods are proposed to predict the defect generation in laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing, without relying on iteration-based computation. The thresholds for the generation of lack-of-fusion, balling and keyholing defects were predicted under various process conditions. The molten pool dimensions in the additive manufacturing process were first calculated by a closed-form analytical thermal model. The heat input from laser source, heat loss at part boundaries and effect of powder bed porosity on thermal properties were considered in the thermal model. The obtained molten pool information was then employed in the calculation of the thresholds for defects. One criterion for the calculation of threshold for lack-of-fusion defect was presented; one criterion for balling and one criterion for keyholing were also proposed.\n\nThe experimental investigations of Ti6Al4V, Inconel 718 and 316L in powder bed fusion were employed to validate the proposed analytical methods. The predicted thresholds of these defects have good agreement with experimental results. The computational time for the presented models is less than five minutes on a personal computer with a Intel i5 processor running at $3 . 4 \\ : \\mathrm { G H z }$ . The balling threshold has negative relationships with both laser power and scan speed. The lack-of-fusion threshold has negative and positive relationships with power and speed, respectively. The keyholing threshold holds positive and negative relationships with power and speed, respectively. The acceptable prediction accuracy and high computational efficiency of the proposed methods will make them good tools for the optimization of process conditions in powder bed fusion. Furthermore, the presented models can be a good basis for future research on the prediction of defects of complex parts in additive manufacturing.",

The improper combination of process parameters results in poor build quality with a significant number of defects in the as-built parts. Among the various alloy systems processed by AM techniques,the Ti-6Al-4V alloy exhibits remarkable characteristics such as high fracture toughness,corrosion resistance, and considerable strength levels [4].However, to obtain high-quality products, it is necessary to examine the quality of the as-fabricated Ti-6Al-4V alloy components based on the processing parameters of AM techniques.For instance, the influence of the selective laser melting (SLM) process parameters on the microstructures,mechanical properties, and melt-pool geometries of various Ti-based alloys was reported in [5-10]. On the other hand, variations in the process parameters and their influence on the physical and mechanical properties of alloys fabricated using DED are rather limited.Corbin et al.[11] pointed out the effect of DED process parameters on fabricated parts of Inconel 718 while",

In particular, regarding the DED-processed Ti-6Al-4V alloys, only a few studies were aimed to investigate the influence of the process parameters on the geometry and properties of the build parts. Among them, Kobryn et al.[2] considered the power and transverse speed effect on laser deposited Ti-6Al-4V alloy microstructure, porosity,and build height. The effect of processing conditions (substrate thickness and initial substrate temperature, interlayer dwell time, hatch pattern, and a number of deposited layers) on microstructure, porosity,and mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V repairs has been reported in [13]. However, the influence of the major parameters in DED such as the (i) power, (ii) scan speed, (ii) layer thickness,and (iv） powder feed rate on the geometry and the properties of Ti-6Al-4V alloy parts has not been extensively investigated. The appropriate selection of such parameters is critical for the manufacture of quality products. Therefore, further investigation is required to better understand the influence of the process parameters on the characteristics of the DED processed parts,to obtain defect-free and high-quality products.",

Thus,a technique that demonstrates significant cost-effectiveness with respect to process optimization is required.As a consequence,plethora of studies focused on the use of statistical methods such as the Taguchi design approach for the design of experiments for various AM processes [14-18]. Bartolomeu et al. [19] proposed the predictive model (analysis of variance, ANOVA) for the prediction of the mechanical properties of SLMprocessed Ti-6Al-4V alloys.Recently,the implementation of effective machine learning tools in various research fields has increased [2O]. In particular, with respect to AM, machine learning (ML） algorithms have been successfully employed for the detection and identification of defect formation, melt pool signatures,in the laser powder bed fusion process [21-23]. The significance of such methods is based on the correlation of mutually dependent parameters and the simplification of the complex relationships among the parameters, which can serve as a guide for the design of actual experiments.",

Jiang et al. [29] used a backpropagation neural network to predict the printable bridge (support) length in fused deposition techniques. The ANN model helps to reduce the number of required experimental trails and thereby minimizes material waste and fabrication time.Thus,the present study outlines the significance of the ANN based ML method in the optimization of the process parameters of DED-processed Ti-6Al-4V alloy parts with optimum build height and density. The experiments conducted for the development of the ANN model were designed using the Box-Behnken design method [30]. To optimize the model parameters of DED, the power,scan speed, powder feed rate,and layer thickness were considered as inputs for the ANN model,whereas the density and build height of the samples were considered as outputs of the model. Using the developed model, process parameter maps were constructed,which allowed for the identification of the optimum ranges of the process parameters. The effect of individual process variables on the densities and build heights of Ti-6Al-4V alloy parts have been investigated. The processing regions of developed process maps were validated by conducting real experiments.",

    "content": "$0 . 3 \\mathrm { m m }$ (Fig. 3). The other process parameters namely power, scan speed, and powder feed rate were then varied.As can be observed from the figures,as the laser scanning speed increases, the build height of the sample decreased. Among all the samples, irrespective of the layer thickness and powder feed rate, the sample with the low power (250 W) and high scan speed $( 1 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m / m i n } )$ exhibited the minimum build height. This is mainly because a high scan speed leads to a decrease in the laser-metal interaction time, energy input, and the amount of powder deposition per unit area, which results in a lower build height [2].Besides,a higher scan speed with an increase in power tends to increase the build height. This is a similar behavior observed in the case of laser-metal-deposited aluminum and Ti/TiC tracks [31]. Sobiyi et al. [32] reported that the lower deposited height is due to larger melt pool formation with higher scan speeds resulting in a decreased rate of solidification which leads to mixing substrate material with deposit material. In contrast to a high scan speed, a low scan speed with low power significantly increases the build height of the sample. For example, the sample fabricated at a low power $( 2 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { W } )$ ， low scan speed $( 0 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m / m i n } )$ , and high powder feed rate (2 $\\mathrm { { g } / \\mathrm { { m i n } } ) }$ ） exhibited the maximum build height of ${ \\sim } 1 1 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ (Fig.2). In general,an increase in powder feed rate is found to increase the build height of the samples [33], yet the effect is strongly dependent on the combination of other process parameters.",

    "content": "The effect of laser power and scan speed on the microstructural changes of the DED processed Ti-6Al-4V alloy was noted here. It is observed that these two are the main parameters that can alter the columnar grain size as well as the phase constituents in the alloy.As illustrated in Fig.5,at a constant value of laser power $( 2 5 0 \\mathrm { W } )$ upon increasing the scan speed from 0.3 to $1 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m / m i n }$ , the columnar grain size is decreased from $\\sim 5 0 0$ to $\\sim 1 8 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ resulting from the faster cooling rates attributed with high scan speeds.It has been reported that the high scan speed results in a low energy input (i.e., high cooling rate),which tends to decrease the width of the columnar grains [2]. Similar results have been observed in the case of laser powder bed fusion processed Ti-6Al-4V alloy [35] and 316L stain steel [36]. Besides, the effect of power on columnar grain size is quite contradictory to the scan speed. Increasing the power from 250 to $4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { W }$ (at a constant scan speed of $1 . 2 \\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { m i n }$ ),the columnar grain size was considerably increased from $\\sim 8 7$ to $\\sim 2 3 2 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ as illustrated in Fig. 6. Kobryn et al.[2] studied the variation of prior $\\beta$ grain width with respect to the power however the authors stated that the grain width was unaffected by power level. Recently, Kohnen et al.[37] reported the parameters which lead to favorable microstructure refinement during AM. The lower melt pool penetration depth, higher cooling rates,and minimum thermal gradient to solidification velocity ratio are highly recommended to attain the finer microstructure.In general, with increasing the laser power, the penetration depth of the melt pool gets deeper and wider [38] and the cooling rate of deposited material gets lowered. Thus,the higher power during additive manufacturing results in the coarser columnar grains.",

    "content": "To investigate the effect of power and scan speed on the microstructure of the alloy, the samples deposited with low and high combinations of scan speed and laser power were taken into consideration and their respective EBSD (image quality (IQ) $^ +$ inverse pole figure (IPF)） micrographs are shown in Fig.7.From the figure, it is clear that irrespective of the laser power, the higher scan speed $( 1 . 2 \\mathrm { m / m i n } )$ )results in martensitic transformation as illustrated in Fig.7 a and c. On the other hand, the samples deposited with the lower scan speed $( 0 . 3 \\mathrm { \\ m / m i n } )$ clearly show the $\\alpha$ phase (see Fig. $^ \\textrm { \\scriptsize 7 b }$ and d) regardless of the laser power. The possible reason for the variation in microstructure is that it reduced laser-metal interaction time upon increasing the scan speed, which allows the formation of martensitic structure due to faster cooling rates,whereas the lower scan speed allows the growth of martensite utilizing longer interaction time which may lead to a significant reheating phenomenon on overlaying layers that resembles the annealing treatment results in the formation of $\\alpha$ phase [3]. From Fig.7 b and d, it should be pointed out that the sample built with a higher power $( 4 0 0 \\mathrm { W } )$ gives quite thick $\\alpha$ laths (due to high level of heat) as compared to that of the sample built with lower power $( 2 5 0 \\mathrm { W } )$ .

Figure $_ { 9 \\mathrm { ~ c ~ } }$ presents the variation of the error values with respect to the number of iterations.In this study,the iterations were varied from 50oo to 25,000. However,when the model was trained with more than 18000 iterations, the error values were attained a minimum value (MSE 0.000001 and $E _ { t r }$ 0.001124) and remained constant upon further training, as shown in Fig. 9c. The remaining model parameters namely learning rate $( \\eta )$ and momentum $( \\alpha )$ were varied from O.1 to 0.9,and the respective $E _ { t r }$ values were plotted (see Fig. 9d). From the figure, it is clear that the minimum error was observed at the momentum value of 0.9 (indicated by the black arrow). Besides, the optimum value ofthe learning rate, which was O.7 (see Fig. 9d), resulted in the minimum training error. From Fig. 9d, it is noticed that the model trained with a O.6 momentum term exhibits the sudden rise in the error and then decreased with further increment in the momentum term $( > 0 . 6 )$ .This sudden rise in error indicates overfitting of the model, and one should avoid this phenomenon to attain high prediction accuracy with the model. Similarly, the learning rate value of O.9 also tends to increase the error drastically.Reddy et al. [43] reported that, in the case of the learning rate, the higher value resulted in an increase in $E _ { t r }$ due to the overfitting of the model. Therefore, the model that consisted of two hidden layers with 15 neurons with 18,ooo iterations, a momentum value of O.9,and a learning rate of O.7 was employed to optimize the DED process parameters, to realize high-quality Ti-6Al-4V alloy products. The prediction accuracy of the developed model was evaluated by comparing the measured and predicted density and build height values,as presented in Fig.1O.",

The lower energy input leads to the formation of a lack of fusion defects and thus significantly affects the alloy density [5]. Moreover, the densification of the alloy mainly depends on the material's melt flowability which can be increased by high power levels [44]. The dependence of the build height on the power level and scan speed is illustrated in Fig.11b.Based on the fabricated samples, the most suitable build height was considered as 5-6 mm.However,in the given set of process parameters (Table 1), the measured build height of the samples was varied from 3 to $1 1 \\mathrm { m m }$ .Overall, an increase in the scan speed (from $0 .",

On the other hand, the over build height $\\mathrm { ( > 7 . 5 ~ m m ) }$ ）was observed with different combinations of power and scan speed as highlighted (red color) in Fig. 11b.In general, the laser power density,which is dependent on the temperature gradient and scan speed,determines the laser-metal interactions,which has a direct influence on the build height of the deposited material. The laser-metal interaction time is considerably at a minimum when laser power $( < 3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { W } )$ ）and higher scan speed (1.2 $\\mathrm { { m } } / \\mathrm { { m i n } } )$ ）combinations are lower which resulted in the lower build height in the specimen. With decreasing scan speed ( $\\left( < \\right.$ $0 . 7 ~ \\mathrm { m / m i n }$ ), the interaction time was relatively high; furthermore,the reheating time of overlying layers rises and this overheating of layers leads to thermal expansion in the samples.Hence,to maintain the optimum sample height in Ti6Al-4V alloy, a proper combination of laser power and scan speed is important.From the results,the optimum build height of the samples (regions highlighted with green) can be obtained by simultaneously increasing the laser power and scan speed (from 0.75 to $1 . 2 \\ \\mathrm { m / m i n }$ )，as shown (green color） in the Fig.11b.

Overall, the change in powder feed rate ( $\\mathrm { ( 0 . 5 ~ g / m i n }$ to2 $\\mathrm { { g / m i n ) } }$ and layer thickness( $0 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ to $0 . 3 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ ）varies the density values to a maximum extent of $0 . 0 2 ~ \\mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 }$ and 0.04 $\\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ ,respectively (see Fig. 12a). With respect to the build height of the sample, the regions with high feed rate-low layer thickness and low feed rate-low layer thickness results increase in build height. The higher amount of powder per unit area with a high feeding rate leads to an increase in the build height,whereas the combination of low layer thickness and feeding rate tends to reheat the overlaying layers during the printing of the subsequent layer cause thermal expansion. Besides, irrespective of the powder feed rate, the high layer thickness $\\mathrm { 0 . 3 } \\mathrm { m m } )$ lowers the build height due to insufficient energy density per layer which can affect the precision of the build samples.

Figure 13 presents the relative importance index values of each process parameter and its influence on the density and build height. It can be seen that the process parameters exhibited similar trends of influence on the outputs; however, the index values were noticeably different.Primarily, the power and feed rate have a positive influence on the density,whereas the increase in scan speed and layer thickness tend to minimize the density of the samples,as shown in Fig.13a. There was a noticeable rise in the build height of the samples in accordance with increasing the feed rate when compared with the power, whereas the scan speed resulted in a significant decrease in the build heights of the samples (Fig. 13b). The estimated index values are in accordance with the experimental observations, and the suggested method was able to give a basic idea regarding the qualitative relationship between input-output parameters.\n\n![](images/7afb66e05091dc2f278f56991eaca969ce605494685ea114e8fed8c693026c6a.jpg)  \nFig.4Thuperpodloartosisitdlhtcioaspeddowowerdtedc anacrosogsofes(d2baedieectedospaeteol\n\nTable2 Selected process parameters for experimental validation of ANN results   ",

    "content": "From the selected regions of both the figures, four sets of process parameters were considered (denoted as S1, S2,PO-1, and PO-2, where PO represents the optimum parameters)and listed in Table 2.It should be noted for PO-1 the process parameters selected from the optimum region where the density and build height values were well maintained with respect to the scan speed and laser power (as indicated in Fig. 14a).As mentioned earlier, the density of the samples is not much varied with layer thickness and powder feed rate; thus, the sample PO-2,in the optimal build height region, is considered for validation of ANN predicted processing map (Fig. 14b). The other two sets of process parameters indicated as S1 and S2(see Fig. 14a) were then selected from the non-optimal parameter regions.The density and build height of the printed samples were measured and tabulated in Table 2.The macroscopic images of the four samples are depicted in Fig.14c. It can be seen that both PO-1 and PO-2 samples showed the optimal density and build height. According to the ANN results,sample S1 (selected from a low density region in Fig.14a) exhibits lower density due to severe lack of fusion defects. In the case of sample S2 (selected from quite high build height region） that shows reasonable density,however, the build height is increased to $\\sim 9 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ ； therefore,such a combination of process parameters should be avoided during printing. From the obtained results,the processing maps developed with the help of ANN predictions can guide the choice of desired process parameters and confirm that the model is a more suitable tool for the process parameter optimization，to allow for the realization of cost-effective and highquality product printing.",

    "content": "# 4 Conclusion\nIn this study,an artificial neural network model was developed for the optimization of the density and build height for the Ti-6Al-4V alloy fabricated by DED.The effect of the process parameters on the density and build height of the Ti6Al-4V samples was determined using the ANN model. The following conclusions were made:\n\n1．The Box-Behnken method was used to design the experimental dataset for the ANN model development. The optimum architecture of the model was achieved by minimizing the training error which demonstrated an excellent prediction accuracy.   \n2. The prior $\\beta$ columnar grain size was decreased with increasing scan speed and increased with increasing the laser power.With respect to the phase constituents, the high scan speed tends to the formation of martensite $( \\alpha ^ { \\prime } )$ ， whereas the lower scan speed forms the $\\alpha$ phase in the DED processed Ti-6Al-4V alloy.   \n3. The developed process maps (based on ANN predictions) can provide clear knowledge regarding the process parameter influence on the density and build height of the samples.   \n4. The suggested set of optimum process parameters yielded appropriate build height and density values.Hence, the ANN model helps to optimize the process parameters for the realization of fabricating high-quality products via the DED process.\n\nAvailability of data and material The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.\n\nCode availabilityThe software used during the current study is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\nFunding This study was supported by the Ministry of Trade,Industry, and Energy (Grant Nos.10077677,20013202,and 16-CM-MA-10).\n\n# Declarations\nConflict of interestThe authors declare no competing interests.",

Titanium alloys have been attractive in the aerospace industry, owing to their high specific strength (i.e., strength-to-weight ratio), fracture toughness, fatigue resistance,and excellent corrosion resistance.1,2 As the largest consumer of titanium, the aviation sector was projected to consume about $^ { 1 5 5 , 0 0 0 \\mathrm { k g } }$ of titanium‘alonein2020.3 Therearetwo stable phases in elemental titanium at the standard atmospheric pressure-the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) $\\mathscr { X }$ phase and the body-centered cubic (bcc) $\\beta$ phase,4 as illustrated in Fig.1a.

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM), sometimes also known as 3D printing, is a disruptive technique that builds up the components with desired complex geometries in a layer-by-layer fashion. AM optimizes the development and fabrication of new products by significantly reducing material wastes and the number of manufacturing steps.Metal AM has received significant attention in the aerospace industry,because of its high material utilization ratio (the buy-to-fly ratio is close to 1:1),short production cycles,and minimal subsequent machining.13,14 The most utilized techniques of metal AM are powder bed fusion (PBF) and directed energy deposition (DED) methods.In PBF,a heat source, either a laser or electron beam, fuses metal powder in a powder bed layer and subsequently consolidates them together. The technique using a laser source is also called laser powder bed fusion (LPBF） or selective laser melting.That based on an electron beam is called electron beam melting. In DED, by contrast, the coaxial heat source (laser or electron beam） moves along with the powder delivery route to melt and fuse powder at specific locations in an object (Fig. 2a). Laser-based DED,also known as laser metal deposition or laser-engineered net shaping,has drawn wider attention due to its higher production rate and more flexible working environment than electron beam-based DED， which requires a vacuum condition.1 The metal wire can also be used as feedstock,known as wire arc additive manufacturing,but our article will focus on the majority of the DED process with powder feedstock.",

Our article reviews the recent progress on the laser-based DED of titanium alloys,while the electron beam-based DED is not the focus of this article.We discuss the processing-microstructure-propertyrelationships and focus on the following aspects:(1) how rapid solidification， thermal cycles, and post-processing heat treatment influence the microstructure evolution;(2) what the yield strength, tensile strength, and ductility of as-deposited and heat-treated titanium alloys are;(3) how defects and residual stresses affect the fatigue properties of the DEDprocessed titanium alloys,and (4) how the complex microstructure and phases influence mechanical properties at both the macroscopic and microscopic scales.\n\n![](images/1b73d6a7a61de8ba252984aeb1dc8cff48b70518c096239cac0512db5fabf023.jpg)  \nFig.2.(a)Schematicftdiectdergdeposito(DED)proc.()itacompressaneepiedusigEDprocsepinte withpermissonfromRef..(cComparisonoftePBFandDEDtechologiesintrmsoflayerthicknessnddeposiorate(eprintedwith permission from Ref.16).\n\nAs new DED equipment, software,and advanced metallurgy are being developed,many new opportunities for fundamental research and technical development are to be exploited.

First,when the solution temperature is higher than $T _ { \\beta , }$ the prior- $\\beta$ grain boundary dissolves and the morphology of prior- $\\beta$ grains varies. The precipitates from the $\\beta$ phase depend greatly on the cooling rate.Water quenching allows the formation ofmetastable hexagonal $( \\alpha ^ { \\prime } )$ ororthorhombic $( \\alpha ^ { \\prime \\prime } )$ martensite while furnace cooling produces stable hexagonal coarse $\\mathscr { X }$ phase.An increase in $\\beta$ stabilizer elements leads to a shift from $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ to $\\alpha ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ martensite in rapidly cooled titanium alloys.38 Other metastable phases, $\\beta ^ { \\prime }$ and $\\omega$ phases,also appear in titanium alloys with considerable $\\beta$ -stabilizer elements during rapid cooling or low temperature_aging.39 e.g the $\\omega$ phase in DED-produced Ti55511 alloy.37 Second, when the solution temperature is lower than $T _ { \\beta , }$ the prior- $\\beta$ grain remains stable but the $\\mathscr { X }$ grains evolve.

Similar to laser welding, pores in the DED process can be categorized as keyhole,balling, and gas bubbles.44A keyhole is caused by a massive amount of high energy imposed on a small area, resulting in a melt pool with a narrow and deep shape.45 The resulted melt_pool shape makes it diffcult for the vapor bubbles inside to get out within a short period of cooling time before the materials are solidified, leaving a keyhole inclusion defect inside the produced part.46 Balling occurs at a relatively high laser energy density47: the melted liquid takes the cohesive powder particles and peels away from the surface in close to spherical shapes. The pores can also be formed from entrapped gas bubbles during the DED process. Figure 6c and d illustrates the formation of trapped gas pores in the melt pool.48 Such defects may not significantly affect the tensile strengths,but they play an essential role in the reduction of fatigue resistance of DED parts.",

The temperature in the laser-powder interaction region quickly_ increases, but the hot material region expands and is restricted by the surrounding cooler regions. This restriction induces compressive stress in the hot material region.As the hot region cools and contracts， the contraction of this region is also restricted by the surrounded regions, resulting in permanent tensile residual stresses in the part and leading to a warped product.\n\n![](images/949b5f60a2c2cea4ae93b87d1288990fd21125f9e23b3b613325c4d99cbe3672.jpg)  \nFig.5.SEM images of DED-produced Ti-6A-2Zr-2Sn-3Mo-1Cr-2Nb aloy: (a) as-deposited,(b)solution treated at $\\mathfrak { s } \\mathfrak { s } \\mathfrak { s } \\mathfrak {circ } \\mathfrak { C }$ for $^ { \\textsf { 1 h } }$ with water quenching,(c) solution treated at $\\mathfrak { s } \\mathfrak { s } \\mathfrak { s } \\mathfrak {circ } \\mathfrak { C }$ for 1 h with air cooling,(d) solution treated at $9 3 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C }$ for1 h with air cooling and aged at $6 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C }$ for $4 \\mathfrak { h }$ with aircooling.(e)TEMandschematicmapof thecrab-likestructurein (c).40Reprintedwithpermision fromRef.40",

    "content": "Figure 7a_compares the tensile strength and elongation of the α, $\\alpha + \\beta$ ，and $\\beta$ titanium alloys made by DED.The $\\beta$ titanium alloys show the highest strength but the lowest ductility. The high strength can be attributed to the additional elements (e.g., Cu, Mo, Si, etc.） in $\\beta$ titanium alloys, which dramatically refine the prior- $\\beta$ grains during the solidification process and control the grain growth during thermal cycles.The other reason is the high content of the $\\beta$ phase,which can be converted into a fine precipitated stable $\\mathscr { X }$ phase or metastable phases (martensite and $\\omega$ phase),contributing to the superior strength.The $\\mathscr { X }$ and $\\alpha + \\beta$ titanium alloys also show high strength $( > ~ 1 0 0 0$ MPa) due to the fine $\\mathscr { X }$ and martensite microstructure.The varied elongation could be due to the pores and $\\alpha _ { \\mathbf { G B } }$ in the as-deposited samples.Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) has been employed to close the pores and densify the microstructure,leading_ to higher ductility but lower strength.55-57 By eliminating pores and coarsening the $\\mathscr { X }$ phase,the ductility of the as-deposited Ti1o23 alloy can be doubled, with a reduction of tensile strength by about $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { \\dot { M P a } }$ .58 The presence of $\\alpha _ { \\mathbf { G B } }$ also plays an essential role in deteriorating the ductility of DED titanium. For example, Ti6242 alloy shows a low elongation $( < 3 \\% )$ ,because a continuous film of $\\alpha _ { \\mathbf { G B } }$ acts as the weakness. Low elongation $( \\sim 5 . 2 \\% )$ in the DEDproducedTi-5Al-4Mo-2Zr-2Sn-4Cr alloy is also attributed to the continuous $\\alpha _ { \\mathbf { G B } }$ ， along which the cracks are easily_ propagated.60 Ren et al.61 also reported a lower elongation of Ti-6.5Al-3.5Mo-1.5Zr0.3Si alloy compared to that of the wrought sample $10 \\%$ vs.",

    "content": "Here, three specific effects induced by heat treatment are highlighted.First,the solution temperature and cooling rate can control the formation of phases as well as their size and content to achieve the strength-plasticity synergy. The strength-plasticity synergy of Ti6242 alloys can be achieved when the content and width of the $\\mathscr { X }$ and $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ phases are optimized.73 The $\\mathrm { T i } – 5 . 5 \\mathrm { A l } – 3 . 3 8 \\mathrm { S n } – 3 . 3 4 \\mathrm { Z r } – 0 . 3 7 \\mathrm { M o } –$ 0.46SiandTi-6.5Al-2Zr-1V-1Moalloysshow improved strength and ductility after two stages of heat treatment.41,75 The increased ductility is attributed to the high content of $\\beta$ phase after the first high-temperature annealing $( \\sim 1 0 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ ,while the high strength originates from the formation of crab-like $\\mathscr { X }$ structure (shown in Fig. 5e), fine lamellar transformed $\\beta$ ,and $\\mathrm { T i } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { A l }$ precipitates during the second modest-temperature annealing $( \\sim 7 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ Second,annealing at a temperature higher than the $\\beta$ -transus alters the morphology and size of the prior- $\\beta$ grains,reducing the anisotropy of the tensile properties.64 Yang et al.79 found that increasing the size of prior- $\\beta$ grains can strengthen the Ti-6.5Al$3 . 5 \\mathrm { M o } { - } 1 . 5 \\mathrm { Z r } { - } 0 . 3 \\mathrm { S i }$ alloys, due to the strong constraints among the grains.

Figure 8a compares the $S { - } N$ curves of three types of DED-produced titanium alloys (data from Ref84-86).Under the same strength amplitude, Ti-6Al-4V shows the lowest fatigue life due to its high density of surface pores. The pores closer to the surface cause higher stress concentrations,increasing the propensity of fatigue crack initiation.85 The increased fatigue life in the Ti6.5Al-3.5Mo-1.5Zr-0.3Si and Ti-6Al-2Zr-1V-1Mo alloys is due to comparatively fewer surface pores, but their fatigue life decreases with increasing pore diameter.87 The three pore-related mechanisms of crack initiation can be summarized as (1） the element segregation at the surface of the pores makes the alloy brittle,for example,the segregation of Al at the surface of the pores in Ti-6Al-2Zr-1V1Mo alloys87; (2） the appearance of pores or unmelted particles breaks the continuity of grain boundaries around them,where cracks were initiated under cyclic stress; and (3） the sharpest topographies of irregularly shaped pores show the highest local stress, inevitably increasing the possibility of fatigue crack initiation.83 Figure 8b shows a representative fatigue fracture surface consisting of a crack initiation zone (Stage I),a crack propagation zone (Stage II), and a final fracture zone (Stage III). 87",

    "content": "The presence of fine $\\alpha , ~ \\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ ，and other nanoscale precipitates in DED-produced titanium alloys contributes to high fatigue strength but sacrifices ductility. The limited ductility associated with localized dislocation slip also promotes fatigue crack initiation.The microstructure-related crack initiation site is typically located in the prior- $\\beta$ grain boundary and $\\alpha / \\beta$ phase boundary,due to the incompatible local deformation.72 The fatigue crack initiation also relates to the macro-texture or orientation of prior- $\\beta$ grains,which impede dislocation motion and induce incompatible deformation.88 Compared to the fatigue crack initiation,the fatigue crackpropagation is moresensitive to the microstructure. Figure 8c systematically compared the fatigue crack growth behavior of as-forged, asdeposited,and heat-treated Ti-6.5Al-2Zr-1V-1Mo alloy using the $d a / d N { - } \\Delta K$ curves.89 The as-deposited sample exhibits a comparable fatigue crack growth rate with the as-forged sample due to the presence of a high density of the\" $\\alpha / \\beta$ interface. Moreover, the heat-treated sample shows a much lower fatigue crack growth rate,which can be attributed to the increased density of the $\\alpha _ { \\mathrm { { s } } } / \\beta$ interfaces. Figure 8d shows a fatigue crack propagation path,demonstrating the role of phase boundaries in deflecting the fatigue cracks.90 Meanwhile, thespecial microstructural features, $\\mathscr { X }$ colony boundaries,91 heat-affected bands,91 and discontinuous $\\alpha _ { \\mathrm { G B } } ^ { \\mathrm { \\ 9 2 } }$ also deflect or retard crack propagation. It should be noted unstable fatigue crack propagation occurs when the stress intensity factor $( K _ { V } )$ reaches the critical value, $K _ { \\mathrm { I C } }$ (fracture toughness). However, studies on the fracture toughness of DEDproduced titanium alloys,especially beyond Ti-6Al4V alloys, are scarcely reported.",

    "content": "# Micromechanical Studies of Titanium Alloys by AM\nThe development of micro-/nano-mechanical characterization (e.g., nanoindentation and micro-pillar compression) provides powerful tools for probing the mechanical properties of constitutional phases of DED-produced titanium alloys (e.g.,hardness $H$ and modulus $E ^ { 9 4 }$ ).The micromechanical studies assist in understanding the deformation micromechanisms of_titanium alloys. For example, Formanoir et al.95 fabricated Ti-6Al-4V alloys and measured the $H$ of two heat-treated Ti-6Al-4V alloys by nanoindentation tests (Fig.9a, b). The $H$ difference between $\\mathscr { X }$ and $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ is larger than that between $\\mathscr { X }$ and $\\alpha _ { d e c } ^ { \\prime }$ (Fig. 9b),resulting in a more pronounced local strain partitioning and higher ductility in the $\\alpha + \\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ titanium alloy (Fig. 9c,d). These results demonstrated the significance of the micromechanical properties of phases in controlling the local and global deformation of titanium alloys.More work should be carried out to establish the relationship between the microscale and macroscale mechanical properties of DED-produced titanium alloys.\n\n# CHALLENGES AND FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES\nThe rapid development of the aerospace industry poses an urgent challenge to speed up the manufacturing rate and lower the cost of titanium components for many demanding applications. Despite the increasing popularity of AM of titanium alloys,there are still numerous challenges that restrict its potential. Meanwhile, a few emerging research directions have attracted significant attention to promoting the fundamental and technical development of the AM of metals.",

    "content": "# In Situ Characterization, Monitoring, and Mechanical Testing\nFirst,in situ characterization: Recent studies have incorporated in situ X-ray characterizing techniques in synchrotron to directly observe melt pool dynamics,microstructural feature formation,and phase evolution during layer upon layer deposition.96 Such methodology offers_a new opportunity tofundamentally understand the underlying formation mechanism of defects and the solidification process in DED.Second, in situ monitoring: high-speed and infrared cameras can be used to detect melt pools, spatters, plumes,and temperatures.97 This monitoring method allows for exploring the optimized processing parameters to reduce the defects and residual stresses in the final components.And third,in situ mechanical testing: the effects of complex phases,microstructures, interfaces,defects,and anisotropy on the mechanical properties of the DED-produced parts are still not well understood. A better understanding of these effects can be benefited from using emerging in situ mechanical tests, such as tensile,compression, bending,fracture,and fatigue tests in SEM and TEM chambers.\n\n![](images/bf8d5f45d9b9a9f20a803e066773bf614e47fb9d546273564afc5de95ee6290c.jpg)  \nFig. 9..

    "content": "The capability of feeding dissimilar metal powders also allows the DED approach to fabricate functionally graded materials.10o So far, the structural graded titanium alloys (e.g., Ti/TiAll0l and TiAl/Ti2AlNb102), microstructural graded titanium alloys (e.g., Ti-6Al $\\cdot 4 \\mathrm { V } ^ { 1 0 3 } .$ , and compositional graded titanium alloys (e.g.，Ti-Cr alloyl04) have been successfully fabricated. There is growing research attempting to produce graded materials by delivering elemental powders from two (or more) nozzles. Direct in situ alloying can be a practical solution to increase manufacturing flexibility and save time and cost by eliminating the_production steps required for prealloyed powders.105 However, a few challenges must be circumvented, including(1) the local non-equilibrium thermal and chemical conditions raise the difficulty of predicting phase composition and microstructure,and (2) the generalized processing principle from one material to another is still lacking.Meanwhile,most of the titanium alloys for the AM are based on conventional compositions for casting or forging.Many of these alloys are not ideal for the AM process (rapid cooling and solidfication),and, consequently, they form pores,cracks, or brittle phases.Therefore, the design of new alloys specific for the DED process is also highly desiable. As an emerging feld of metallurgy,new multicomponent alloys or high-entropy_alloys are also interesting for producing by DED.65",

Machine learning_has been rapidly developed in the past decade.108 Highthroughput experiments together with machinelearning algorithms can be exploited to accelerate the discovery of new alloys for DED. Meanwhile, machine learning, morespecifically computer vision，can be used to predict the melting pool temperature,65 5 to enhance real-time image capturing,and to correlate the printing parameters for the geometrical attributes of the deposited metal trace. Such a machine-learning approach can be used to develop closed-loop control AM systems. Thus,the development of machine learning and more available datasets pave the way for the next-generation DED process of new titanium alloys.",

Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF)，asan advanced additive manufacturing (AM) technology,has attracted significant attention and has been implemented in research and industry over the last two decades.It has a wide range of advantages such as producing nearly fully dense and complex shaped components at a high resolution (which cannot be realized via conventional methods), high material utilization with limited machining,and reduced lead times18,19.\n\nSpecifically，LPBF is a complicated metallurgical process, which involves powder melting and extremely fast directional solidification,re-melting and re-solidification during the subsequent scan tracks and layers,and postsolidification thermal cycling. The understandingof microstructure evolution during the LPBF process and post-process treatment is essential to obtain Ti-6Al-4V components with high quality and satisfied properties. In thisreview，the LPBF technique and its processing parameters are briefly introduced.

Machining and electropolishing are effective methods to remove the surface layer, which contributes to the lowest surface finish $\\mathrm { ( R _ { a } ) }$ below $1 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } } ^ { 5 7 , 6 0 }$",

    "content": "In general, plastic deformation prior to heat treatment is essential for inducing globularization in thermomechanically processed Ti-6Al-4V. While in LPBF fabricated Ti-6Al4V,plastic deformationisnot requiredforthe globularization to occur. Because the high dislocation density inherited from the LPBF process can initiate the globularization. The globularization mechanism is similar for LPBF fabricated and thermomechanically processed Ti6Al-4V. Tangled dislocationsin $\\alpha ^ { \\ast }$ martensitecan rearrange into dislocation arrays and form sub-grain boundaries during the $\\alpha { + } \\beta$ solution treatment107. In the initial stage of globularization, dislocation arrays and subgrain boundaries are the feasible locations for the boundary splitting process, which includes the growth of $\\beta$ phase into the sub-grain boundary (thermal grooving） and edge spheroidization at lamellae ends1.For a prolonged solution treatment, the globularization is driven by the second mechanism related to the $\\mathfrak { a }$ lamellae coarsening by termination migration consisting of mass transfer from curved surface to flat surfaces.This results in shorter and thicker ${ \\mathfrak { a } } _ { \\mathfrak { p } }$ lamellae,which gradually change the lamellar morphology to a more equiaxed morphology109\n\n![](images/dc640dc2bee5ad08c9558bc7784b34549aa3c2e44507a4c748dc1044e1449264.jpg)  \nFig.10Effectofheat treatment temperatureonmicrostructure.aEBSDorientationmapofpost-processheat reatedatsub-transus $8 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 2 \\mathrm { h } / \\mathrm { F C } ^ { \\mathrm { 8 4 } }$ b EBSD orientation map of post-process heat treated at super-transus $1 0 2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 0 . 5 \\mathrm { h }$ followed by sub-transus $7 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } / 2 \\mathrm { h } / \\mathrm { A C } ^ { \\mathrm { \\scriptscriptstyle S 4 } }$ The deposition direction in both images is in vertical direction.",

The increase in strength is attributed to the refinement in both martensite width and prior- $\\cdot \\beta$ grain size, and the enhanced ductility is related to the reduced strain localization due to the shortened martensite,which is limited bythe prior $\\beta$ grain size126 Twosimilar observations have been reported in LPBF fabricated Ti6Al-4V,inwhichafullymartensiticlamellar microstructure with a fine prior- $\\boldsymbol { \\cdot } \\boldsymbol { \\beta }$ grain width between 50- $1 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ results in high strength and ductility127,128.For such an approach to achieve good tensile properties,the key is to have a small prior $\\beta$ grain sizel26. It is known that the prior- $\\beta$ grain width is related to the hatch distance in laser continuous scan strategy and the point distance in pulsed laser strategy. A small hatch distance can provide a narrow prior- $\\beta$ width, but it sacrifices the productivity. In addition, cautiously controlled laser processing parametersare required to avoid the $\\beta$ formation during the in-process thermal cycling, because the low volume of thin $\\beta$ film causes stress concentration, which decreases ductility228.",

Thisis consistent with the fractographs shown in Fig.14e and f, which indicate that surface related defects are responsible for the inferior fatigue strength in the as-built sample,and fatigue crack initiation site is at the sample interior when the surface defects are removed by machining. The comparable or even higher HCF strength in improved surface conditions is because the LPBF fabricated Ti-6Al4V has a much finer microstructure than wrought and cast Ti-6Al-4V,which means a short effective dislocation slip length and a high resistance to fatigue crack initiation.",

    "content": "The mechanical properties of high specific strength and excellent corrosion resistance make titanium alloys such as Ti-6Al-4V attractive for a variety of applications of biomedical devices,aircraft,and aeroengines [1-3].Most titanium alloy components are conventionally shaped from the various mill products,of which plate and sheet comprise beyond $4 0 \\%$ 、The Ti-6Al-4V alloy plate with good performance is typically prepared by multiple thermal-mechanical processing. The procedure involves forging into alloy bloom from ingot first and then hot rolling into a slab,which further receives hot reductions when the desired thickness fora plate was obtained.Finally,the final plate is subjected to an annealing treatment and surface conditioning by grinding and/or pickling. So,the procedure involves high costs and a long production cycle time [4]．In addition，surface oxidation, non-metallic inclusions,and even delamination during hot working will deteriorate the titanium alloy properties [5].",

    "content": "The emerging high energy beam-based additive manufacturing (AM has received more attention nowadays because it possesses many attractive advantages such as great design freedom,flexibility,high material utilization,short product development time compared with the conventional manufacturing methods [6-9]. The selective laser melting (SLM)and electron beam melting (EBM),as two representative members of the AM family,has developed rapidly in recent years.The main difference between SLMand EBM lies in the higher production efficiency of EBM $( 5 5 - 8 0 c m ^ { 3 } / h )$ than that of SLM $( 1 0 { - } 3 0 c m ^ { 3 } / h )$ because there is no reflection beam energy loss when the electron beam melts the metal powders.The typical 3D printing defects such as porosity,residual stress,and microstructure such as unstable $\\alpha ^ { \\ast }$ martensite,are found for both SLMed and EBMed titanium alloys [1O-14] although their characteristic features are somewhat different.From the viewpoint of social and technological interests, the main differences among traditional mill annealing,SLM,and EBM were summarized in Table1.",

[2O] investigated the relationship between the process-pores-mechanical properties for SLM and EBM alloys and the finding is that the large defects produced in EBM are more sensitive to process parameter variation. The same aspects are missing in reference [21],which compared the microstructural details and tensile strength for the EBMed and wrought Ti-6Al-4Valloy and the main finding is that elongations achieved by EBM is greater for the high-strength forgings but also varied in a large variation range.Rafi etal.[22] investigated and found that the difference in microstructures and mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V parts fabricated by SLM and EBM is related to the different cooling rates.However,the two studies provide litte information on the influence of process-induced pores, residual stress,and texture on the resulting mechanical properties.\n\nThe paper has two major objectives.The first one is to compare the main microstructural features with regards to grain morphology, grain size,phase constituents,and texture induced during different AM and traditional hot working.The second one is to clarify the mechanisms governing the process-induced porosity,residual stress,microstructure, and the mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V alloy.",

Fractography\nFigs.10-12 show the fracture surface morphology of the typical tensile samples fabricated by SLM, EBM,and mill-annealing,respectively.From the low magnification SEM maps (Figs.1Oa-l2a),the appearance of the fracture surfaces has quite different features in the three samples.First,more type-I pores were observed on the fractured surface of the SLMed sample.They have nearly the same size as those measured by Micro-CT.It is suggested that these sphere pores did not develop or coalescence upon tensile loading. Second, some cleavage planes were clearly found in the EBMed sample.These smooth cleavage planes are typically attributed to the break of pre-existing porosity zone, where the large-sized type-II pores are torn open or a high density of type- I pores are coalesced and propagated upon tensile loading. Third, the homogeneous ductile fracture was observed in mill-annealed one. The high magnification maps show that a typical ductile fracture appearance with fine dimples emerges except for the pre-existing porosity region (Fig.11b).The main differences between the dimples lie in the size and shape of the three tensile samples.Much shallower and larger dimples with the averaged size of $5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ in the mill-annealed sample.By comparison,the dimples in the ductile fracture zones for the SLMed and EBMed samples were around $1 { - } 2 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ ，which is at the same level as the $\\alpha ( \\alpha ^ { \\prime } )$ layer thickness.\n\nTable 5 Micro stress and strain under different preparation methods.   \n\n<table><tr><td>Sample Preparation Process</td><td>Strain</td><td>Stress (MPa)</td></tr><tr><td>SLM</td><td>0.00384</td><td>-145.2</td></tr><tr><td>EBM</td><td>0.00124</td><td>-80</td></tr><tr><td>Mill-annealed</td><td>0.000147</td><td>-36</td></tr></table>\n\n![](images/66e2b093218e6145cdc56e5ea37448122e16a75dcebf97df0b248fbfe5633255.jpg)  \nFig. 9.

    "content": "Two main types of pores,spherical (type-I) and elongated pores (type- II),are often observed [25,39]. The type-I pores are caused by entrapped gas associated with the powders produced with a gas atomization process or trapping gas in the environment during SLM and EBM. Alloy vaporization might occur due to extremely high local temperature for the powder or deposited layers when exposed to the laser or electron beams during SLMand EBM.The alloy vapor might become trapped and contracted as nearly or less spherical pores upon cooling.The equivalent diameter is typically smaller and the aspect ratio (AR) is greater than 0.5 for type type-I pores.The elongated pores [39-41] are induced by insufficient melting in subsequent layer deposition.They are typically larger in equivalent diameter [40,42] and characterized by sharp corners and elongated appearance with AR less than or equal to O.5.The number and cumulative size distribution for the two types of pores distinguished by aspect ratio with the threshold of 0.5 were shown in Fig.l3. There are more type-II pores than type-I ones for both samples while the total pore number is quite lower in the SLMed sample than in EBMed one (Fig.l3a). Also,type-I pores with AR larger than 0.5 possess the equivalent diameter of less than $4 0 \\ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } } .$ ,and most of them (around $8 0 \\%$ lessthan $2 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in the SLMed sample.By comparison,type-I pores possess the equivalent diameter of less than $7 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } } ,$ ，and most of them (around $8 0 \\%$ ）less than $4 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ in the EBMed counterpart.

The linear energy density was calculated as 0.207 $\\scriptstyle { J / \\mathrm { m m } }$ and $0 . 1 7 7 \\mathrm { ~ J / m m }$ for the EBMed and SLMed samples.Although linear energy density imposed on the EBMed sample was approximately $1 5 \\%$ higher than on the SLMed one,the layer thickness of alloypowder employed during EBM is 2.5 times that during SLM,which may lead to insuficient melting penetration between the adjacent layers,and therefore the number of type-I pores per unit volume is larger in EBMed sample.It is assumed that the sharp corners of type-II pores would cause stress concentration in tensile testing and exhibited lower-yielding strength and ultimate tensile strength in the EBMed sample compared to the SLMed and mill-annealed one.That is,type-I pores acted as the origins of crack nucleation and were readily torn open upon tensile loading,leaving the cleavage fracture as shown in Fig. 11b.\n\nAt the same time,the melting pool formed during EBM is relatively deep due to a little higher linear energy densityand is more liable to entrapping the alloy vapor or gas.It is why much more type-I pore is also found in the EBMed sample.Such small-sized pores typically have a less detrimental effect on the mechanical properties due to no sharp corners. In addition, the presence of a relatively large number of pores also leads to more scattered data or the uncertainty in the mechanical properties of EBMed samples as shown in Fig.8 and Table 6.",

[45,46].\n\n$$\n\\tau { } = \\tau _ { 0 } + a G b \\sqrt { \\rho }\n$$\n\nwhere $G$ is the modulus, $^ { b }$ is the Burgers vector of dislocation,and $\\tau _ { O }$ and $a$ are constants associated with a given material.\n\nThe magnitude of the residual micro stress is the highest in SLMed samples,which contributes a lot to the high yielding strength and ultimate tensile strength.The significant micro stress-induced in the SLMed sample compared to the other two samples is caused by two main reasons.Firstly,no annealing is employed in the SLMed sample.By comparison, the EBMed samples were in-situ annealed with the chamber temperature of $7 0 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ during building and the mill-annealed ones are post annealed at $7 5 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } .$ So,the residual stress is alleviated in EBMed and mill-annealed samples. Secondly, the melting pool is more locally during SLM because of the smaller laser spot than that of the electron beam.The steeper temperature may lead to high residual stress.",

    "content": "# 4.1.3. Microstructure effect\nThe grain morphology，size,and orientation of the $\\alpha ( \\alpha ^ { \\prime } )$ may contribute to the difference in the properties of the fabricated materials. Acicular $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ martensite (layer thickness $1 { - } 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ (Fig.5) was found in the SLMed and EBMed samples while nearly equiaxed grain (avg. grain size $4 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ was present in the mill-annealed samples.The thickness of the martensite layer is finer and may contribute to the strength based on the Hall-Petch relationship in the SLMed sample.There is weak texture because multiple $\\alpha ^ { \\ast }$ martensite variants were introduced in the SLMed and EBMed sample [47,48]. By comparison, there is a relatively strong (4-2-23) $\\perp$ RD texture evidenced by the prevalence of green-colored grains in the OIM of the cross-section perpendicular to RD (Fig.7).\n\nFor HCP $\\alpha$ crystal with an axis ratio $c / a < 1 . 6 3$ in Ti-6Al-4V alloy, slip may occur on prismatic,basal,and first-type pyramidal planes with the slip directions belonging to the ${ < } 1 1 { - } 2 0 >$ family. In the case of deformation along the c-axis,the slip systems $\\{ 1 0 { - } 1 1 \\} { < } 1 1 { - } 2 3 >$ and $\\{ 1 1 { - } 2 { - } 2 \\} { < } 1 1 { - } 2 3 >$ can also be activated [49,5O].The Taylor factor may tell how difficult to deform the grains during tensile loading.The typical Taylor factor distributions on the cross-section perpendicular to the tensile axis in the mill-annealed sample are shown in Fig.14.Most grains have a low Taylor factor (2.0-2.5),which may contribute to the large elongation to a certain extent for the mill-annealed samples.",

    "content": "# 4.2.Fracture mechanism\nMany pores can be seen on the fractured surface of the SLMed samples and their size is nearly the same as those measured by Micro-CT before tensile testing.It is suggested that these pores did not develop or coalescence upon tensile loading.In addition,although the ductile dimples were prevalent throughout the fracture surface of the SLMed sample,they are not so homogenous in size compared with those in the mill-annealed sample and EBMed samples (see Figs.1Od-12d).It should beascribed to high residual stress present in the SLMed samples.When the severe stress concentration in many local areas occurs upon tensile loading, necking due to inhomogeneous tensile deformation will emerge and finally lead to fracture. During the entire process,more pores or other defects may also act as stress concentration origins and therefore lead to relatively low ductility.By comparison,the pores coalescence or development remarkably occurs and leaves some cleavage planes in the fracture surface in the EBMed sample (Fig.11),where a mixture of the ductile dimples and smooth cleavage plane coexist.Furthermore, the ductile dimples are relatively deep in addition to homogenous size compared with those in SLMed samples.It can be assumed that the mechanical properties would be enhanced significantly if pores, especially type-II pores,be reduced during building for the EBMed samples. The shallow but homogeneous ductile dimples were observed in the fracture surface of the mill-annealed sample.The size is at the same level as the grain size of around $4 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .It can be postulated that the millannealed samples were uniformlyplastically deformed with relatively high elongation before fracture due to a fully dense structure compared to the other two AMed samples.",

    "content": "The use of additive manufacturing (AM) processes for end-use parts have been steadily growing over the past decade.Powder bed fusion (PBF)processes were one of the first AM processes to be used in industrial activities with polymers and eventually with metals,being employed today by various distinct sectors.These processes utilize an energy source for selectively sintering or fusing successive layers of a fine powder feedstock material.Laser PBF processes (L-PBF) [1] use one or more laser beams as energy sources and are currently the most common AM technology for processing metals. Other energy sources for PBF processes include the electron beam (EB), in which kinetic energy from accelerated electrons is converted to thermal energy upon impact into the powder bed [2].This particular process is known commercially as Electron Beam Melting (EBM),and while detailed explanations of this process can be found elsewhere [3],it is worth highlighting the main distinctions with laser processes.For instance,the electron beam is controlled by electromagnetic lenses instead of the mirror deflecting mechanism of laser systems,allowing faster scanning speeds as there are no moving parts [4].Parts produced by electron beam powder bed fusion processes (EB-PBF)[1] are also not affected by the adverse effects of the different laser beam incidence angles that are known to affect the final quality of parts [5]. Moreover, electron beams are more homogenously absorbed by metallic powders than lasers and can reach farther into the material powder bed [6].However,EB-PBF also differs from laser processes in aspects beyond the energy source.EB-based processes happen in a near-vacuum chamber to avoid the deflection of electrons by air molecules,with a small amount of Helium gas to secure the chemical stability of reactive metals [4].",

    "content": "The lack of a constant inert gas flow as itis required in L-PBF is also beneficial for EB-PBF since the mechanical properties and quality of parts are influenced by the gas inlet's position and flow direction [7].Another noteworthy difference between EB and laser PBF processes is that the powder bed and build chamber are kept at high temperatures throughout the entire EB-PBF process,producing parts free of residual stresses [8].The high internal temperatures in EB-PBF are achieved through preheating stages performed at each newly deposited layer,heating the material to around $6 0 \\%$ of its melting point to sinter the feedstock powder particles [9]. Besides elevating the temperatures,the powder sintering is required to avoid particle repulsion and create conductivity paths for the incident electrons on the powder bed [1O,11].A sintered powder bed also provides a more solid base for building overhang structures and allows the production of stacked parts for increased productivity,a strategy known as nesting [12].\n\nMost applications involving EB-PBF rely on high-performance alloys such as Inconel 718 and Ti-6Al-4V. The latter offers excellent mechanical performance and high corrosion resistance,being initially developed by the aerospace industry,where the strength-to-weight ratio is of utmost importance [13],while AM's geometric freedom creates opportunities for further mass reductions in aerospace components [14].The superior corrosion resistance and biocompatibility of Ti-6Al-4V make this alloy also suitable for medical implants.In this case,AM's design freedom was already proven valuable,with Ti-6Al-4V EB-PBF manufactured acetabular cup implants passing the mark of 1oo,ooo implanted patients in 2018 [15].Ti-6Al-4V is also one the most investigated materials with EB-PBF in academia,being in almost $7 0 \\%$ of all papers and publications in the reviewed literature for this study on surface roughness, followed by Inconel 718 (Fig.1).",

    "content": "Though EB-PBF has proven suitable for processing Ti-6Al-4V for high-demand applications,it is not without its challenges.Besides issues related to internal porosity and anisotropy,the surface quality of EB-PBF parts is considered poor compared to other fabrication methods such as machining.The additive layer-stacking method of PBF processes generates significantly different surfaces within the same part.Surfaces strictly parallel to the build platform,like the top and bottom surfaces, are formed by one single layer,whereas the side or lateral surfaces are made by several stacked layers,creatinga superficial stepping effect. The processing phenomena experienced by the top and lateral surfaces during manufacturing also contribute to the notably different surface appearance and texture [16,17],as seen in Fig. 2.Top surfaces generally displaya significantly better surface quality compared to lateral ones. For Ti-6Al-4V parts produced by EB-PBF,the Ra roughness values for top surfaces usually range from 1 to $1 3 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ [18-20],and its topology is dominated by weld tracks left by the electron beam scanning paths [19, 21].The lateral surfaces,on the other hand,display Ra values that range between 15 and $5 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ [20,22-26]，constituting a roughness level comparable to rough manufacturing processes like sand casting,sawing, hot rolling,and forging [27].The topology of lateral surfaces is characterized by a rippled structure caused by successive layer stacking and the presence of partially melted powder particles attached to them (Fig. 2) [28-32].",

    "content": "For EB-PBF processes specifically,the adverse effects of the associated surface roughness in fatigue are very well established [37].EB processes generate distinct surface structures detailed in Section 4 that act as stress concentration points that stimulate fatigue cracking [38, 39].Fractography analyses show that fatigue cracks in EB-PBF with Ti-6Al-4V start from micro-notches on the surface and then propagate [40-43],being directly correlated to its higher surface roughness levels. In fact,surface roughness was verified to be the most critical aspect regarding fatigue performance in EB-PBF,even more impactful than porosity defects [41,42,44,45]. Still, proper surface finishing processes have shown promising results in improving the fatigue life of EB-PBF parts.Kahlin et al. [38] showed that machined and polished specimens of Ti-6Al-4V had fatigue limits $7 5 \\%$ higher than those in the as-built condition.Vayssette et al.[46] compared the multiaxial high cycle fatigue performance of Ti-6Al-4V specimens by EB-PBF in the as-built condition and with chemical polishing,with the latter showing an improved fatigue limit of around $4 6 \\%$ .Though proven beneficial to increasing fatigue performance,both traditional or alternative surface finishing processes can be particularly challenging with PBF parts,as will be detailed in Section 3.",

    "content": "Surface roughness is known to positively influence living cell attachment [47,48],therefore the surface roughness in EB-PBF parts for medical applications such as implants is also proficiently studied.The particular topology of EB-PBF surfaces creates a more extensive contact surface between implant and organism,promoting better adhesion levels according to experiments by Thomsen et al.[49] with Ti-6Al-4V. The same phenomenon was confirmed in later studies [5O-52] with the same alloy and process,though the optimal levels of surface roughness for enhanced cell attachment are still debatable.Nevertheless,the roughness levels of as-built EB-PBF with Ti-6Al-4V were found beneficial to blood coagulation processes that favor healing in implants as well [22].Another positive effect of the roughness levels of EB-PBF in the medical sector was verified by Lindsay et al.[53] for transcutaneous implants.Traditionally machined and EB-PBF Ti-6Al-4V parts were compared in terms of osseointegration and contamination by external agents.The AM specimens in the as-built condition consistently outperformed the machined parts in both the mechanical and microbiological barrier tests [53].\n\nThe effects of surface roughness in fluid systems such as heat exchangers or in conformal cooling channels of dies are also worth noting since these are identified as suitable applications for PBF processes [36]. Surface roughness can profoundly affect the performance and service life of these systems,either positively or negatively.The as-built roughness levels of EB-PBF can enhance the convective heat transfer through surfaces [54],though in cooling channels,it can cause severe pressure drops and create difficulties for unprocessed powder removal after manufacturing [55].",

    "content": "The correlation between process variables and the parts’ resulting properties is crucial, especially for sensitive manufacturing processes like EB-PBF,in which materials undergo a series of heating cycles and rapid melting [56].While the influence of process variables on the surface roughness of EB-PBF parts has been investigated,any definitive correlations are challenging to establish primarily due to this process's complexity and novelty.This work aims to explore the literature regarding the influence of process variables on surface roughness of Ti-6Al-4V by EB-PBF to provide insights valuable for new experimental research in related fields and to access the potential of controlling the surface quality through process optimization.\n\nThis review starts by discussing the various surface metrology methods utilized for evaluating metal PBF surfaces (Section 2).Section 3 describes some surface finishing processes reported with this alloy and process,while the main mechanisms behind the distinct topology and roughness of EB-PBF surfaces are introduced in Section 4.Section 5 details the process variables known to influence the surface roughness of Ti-6Al-4V specifically,whereas Section 6 mentions other process-related factors contributing to surface roughness in EB-PBF and provides recommendations for future works.",

Surface metrology of metal PBF parts\nEvery manufactured surface deviates from its intended ideal,and the geometric divergences affect many functional aspects as already mentioned.Whitehouse [57] characterized the surface deviations according to their causes and wavelength scale:\n\n·Roughness:superficialirregularitiesassociatedwiththe manufacturing process,like tool marks from machining processes and impressions left by grinding or polishing. ·Waviness:superficialirregularitiescausedbyimproper manufacturing,including machinery's poor performance or miscalibration,with longer wavelengths than roughness. ·Form error: dimensional and geometrical deviations of greater wavelengths,caused by inaccuracies in machinery's slides or guideways,or by thermal distortion.\n\nFig.3 illustrates a typical surface profile comparing its roughness and waviness components. Surface profiles have two main domains: the amplitude or height of the profile,and its wavelength [33].The amplitude and wavelength scale of roughness and waviness differ significantly,and these surface features are usually evaluated independently as they are generated from separate mechanisms and affect the function of parts differently.This study focuses on the roughness component and the microphysical irregularities that characterize the surface texture of EB-PBF.There are two complementary approaches to surface roughness: one is concerned with its influence on functional aspects,while the other utilizes surface measurements to gauge and control manufacturing processes [58]. Since the roughness is highly susceptible to changes in the process,any noticeable variation in roughness parameters can indicate process deviations,making surface metrology a powerful tool for quality control [59].\n\n![](images/59ffbc016994bda42d816684487b61adb4ece3e453225352f5dad34ff2b281a3.jpg)  \nFig.3.

    "content": "Different surface measurement techniques can extract the topography information from a sampled surface.The instruments involved in surface metrology predominantly consist of tactile devices with a stylus or non-contact instruments based on optical instruments [29].EB-PBF processes produce naturally rough surfaces for reasons that will be further explored in Section 4,but its inherent surface characteristics, such as sharp protrusions,deep recesses,and undercuts,present several challenges for measurement regardless of the type of instrument [31].\n\nTactile-based methods with stylus remain the industry's most used surface measurement methods due to their operational simplicity, lowcostequipment， andgoodrepeatability[60,61]．However, contact-based methods can underperform depending on the scale of interest.Fig.4a illustrates a surface profile measurement with a probing stylus.The amount of topographic details registered by the stylus depends on its tip cone's size and shape,sometimes acting as a low-pass filter for small-scale features [6l].There are also concerns when measuring low hardness materials since the stylus can cause irreversible damage to the surfaces.Besides these operational challenges,tactile methods face additional obstacles when measuring EB-PBF surfaces. These methods can usually register only one-dimensional profiles, being intrinsically limited for assessing the heterogeneous and anisotropic surfaces created by metal PBF processes [62].Nevertheless,contact methods with stylus probing are well-established and highly reproducible,being verified as the most common method used for surface evaluation of metal AM parts [60].",

    "content": "A wide variety of optical-based devices can be utilized for surface metrology through various measurement techniques. Contactless surface measurement excludes the risk of surface damage and has fewer accessibility limitations compared to stylus instruments (Fig. 4b). For metallic PBF parts,typical measuring techniques with optical instruments include focus variation microscopy,confocal microscopy,and coherence scanning interferometry [6O].All these methods are used for areal surface evaluation,in which three-dimensional data is acquired from a sampling area instead of a linear profile [63].For this reason, optical-based methods are seen as a more complete way of assessing the roughness of metallic PBF parts [16,64,65],although not without limitations.According to Leach etal.[62], the abrupt alternation of dark and bright regions of deep recesses and sharp protrusions,plus non-uniform optical properties due to surface oxidization,are among the biggest challenges for optical measurement with PBF.Moreover,every optical system depends on materials'reflective properties,and some contactless methods have been reported to be inadequate for measuring the highly reflective top surfaces of metallic PBF parts [18]. It is also worth noting that optical instruments cannot effectively capture undercut surface features just as tactile methods cannot (Fig.4b).\n\n![](images/beeec5d9ae81c225a2bf902acd878ec7f200053afbdd4b729914a9ba52227fa3.jpg)  \nFig.4.Schematics of surface profile measurements and the registered profile with (a) stylus probing and (b) optical device.",

These technologies have been used in elaborate measurement procedures that extract topographic information from XCT data of inspected surfaces [68]. However,XCT usually lacks the appropriate spatial resolutions for capturing the smallest surface details of metallic PBF parts,although increasingly investigated as an alternative surface measurement method [69].2D imaging devices such as scanning electron microscope (SEM) are also commonly used for qualitative analysis of metal PBF surfaces as they cannot measure topographic height information directly [59,63].\n\nNo single surface measurement instrument or technique can accurately capture the exact topographies of metal PBF surfaces on their own.Several authors [6O-62] point toward using a combination of methods for more precisely accessing all the surface features and the roughness of PBF parts.The ultimate goal of the surface measurement and the subsequent planned analysis should also be considered when selecting instruments and measurement methods.",

The truncheon [73] (Fig.5a) was one of the first surface test artifacts for AM, initially designed for stereolithography processes but also used for metal PBF processes [74].It comprises a series of tilted flat surfaces with 5-degree increments to analyze different orientations in relation to the build platform.ISO/ASTM 52902 75] proposes a series of geometric test artifacts for AM processes,including those specific for surface texture evaluation.These artifacts are composed of seven labeled plates tilted in 15-degree increments (from $0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ ) that can be individually detached for tactile and optical measurements (Fig.5b). Overall, the experiments in the reviewed literature followed a similar approach to that of the ISO/ASTMstandard,relying on testartifacts comprised of flat plates or disks manufactured in different orientations and slopping angles.

Regardless of the type of measured data (profile or areal),the standardized parameters for roughness are mainly divided into amplitude,spatial,and hybrid parameters.Amplitude and spatial parameters quantify the two primary domains of surface topographies: height and wavelength,respectively, whereas hybrid parameters combine the two [8O].Amplitude parameters used to be considered more relevant as they were thought to better relate to function [57],although few amplitude or spatial parameters can be directly correlated to functional properties.Moreover,there has beena historical preference by the industry to utilize average amplitude parameters,which reflects the primary use of surface metrology as a quality control tool for manufacturing [33].\n\n![](images/487ff94b4e091c40b63feb623e9d9a67964fba93554a1ec95e2a992fa7b49b96.jpg)  \nFig.5Diftertfactsdffaceevaaoedes],/5]ati",

These suggested parameters include the profile arithmetic mean deviation (Ra),maximum height of profile (Rz),the skewness (Rsk),and the kurtosis (Rku) of the height distribution,as well as their correspondent areal parameters - Sa, Sz, Ssk,and Sku, respectively. The Ra average parameter is defined by ISO 4287 [78] and computes the arithmetic mean deviation in microns $\\left( \\mu \\mathrm { { m } } \\right)$ from peaks and valleys about the mean line (Fig.6).The skewness and kurtosis (Rsk and Rku) parameters describe the relationship between the height distribution of the sampled profile and a Gaussian distribution,with the first potentially providing indications of a predominance of peaks or valleys and the second the sharpness of the profile [60].",

    "content": "Mechanical finishing processes were the most typical methods utilized within the reviewed literature.These processes are regarded as the most effective in enhancing the mechanical properties of metallic AM parts,regardless of the inherent mechanism (material removal or deformation） [83].Among the mechanical finishing processes,conventional machining remains the most common for metallic PBF parts, being reported to reduce the surface roughness of Ti-6Al-4V parts by EB-PBF to Ra levels as low as $0 . 0 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ [84].Machining operations can also achieve the desired dimensional accuracy of parts and remove near-surface defects such as pores depending on the depth of cut [85], both of which are highly beneficial to fatigue.However, Ti-6Al-4V can be particularly tough to machine due to its high chemical reactivity,low thermal conductivity,and relatively low modulus of elasticity [86,87]. Mechanical finishing techniques based on plastic deformation have also become widespread with metallic PBF parts.Although the finished surfaces might not be as smooth as in material removal processes,these methods can improve the mechanical properties by inducing compressive residual stresses on the surface,promoting near-surface pore closure,and refining surface grain [88].Soyama and Takeo [89] analyzed the effects of various peening surface treatments on the roughness and fatigue performance of Ti-6Al-4V specimens by both L-PBF and EB-PBF. Shot peening was by far the most efective, reducing Ra values from $1 9 . 3 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to around $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in EB-PBF specimens,while cavitation peening only showed a marginal reduction.However,the observed effects on fatigue were very significant for both treatments since they introduced similar levels of compressive residual stresses on the surfaces,with a $7 5 \\%$ increase in fatigue strength at $\\Nu = 1 0 ^ { \\circ } 7$ for cavitation peening and $9 5 \\%$ for shot peening in EB-PBF parts [89].",

    "content": "While peeing techniques can be more flexible in dealing with highly complex structures than conventional machining,mechanical surface finishing processes are limited to accessible regions.For treating internal surfaces and channels in EB-PBF,or even intricate structures like lattice and cellular geometries,chemical and electrochemical surface finishing processes can be very effective [83].These processes work the entire geometry of parts as they are completely submerged,and the amount of material removed is usually controlled by the composition of the solution,exposure times,temperature,and electrical voltage and current in the latter case [9O].Lhuisser et al.[31] showed that a chemical etching process with a Hydrofluoric acid (HF) and Nitric Acid (HNO3) solution could uniformly reduce the Ra roughness of Ti-6Al-4V struts by EB-PBF from around $3 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ to $2 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ in $6 0 \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ .The authors observed a more rapid roughness reduction in the first $2 0 \\ \\mathrm { m i n }$ of the process,when the partially melted powder particles were preferably removed.The underlying surface irregularities were smoothed in the remaining $4 0 \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ at a much slower pace [31].Electrochemical polishing processes are faster than chemical etching,though restricted to conductive materials, and could lead to dimensional issues in the treated parts if not properly controlled [9O].Wu et al. [91] showed that,with proper solution and parameters,the Ra roughness of Ti-6Al-4V specimens by EB-PBF could be reduced from around $2 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $4 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in only $2 0 \\mathrm { { m i n } }$",

However,for EB-PBF with Ti-6Al-4V,the reported Ra values obtained from profile measurements performed both along and across the build direction showed little difference - only up to $4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ on average [19,100, 101].While this can be considered a small contribution considering the level of roughness in lateral surfaces,the severity of the staircase effect on the surface quality of EB-PBF parts relies on factors detailed in Section 5.",

    "content": "Another mechanism known to contribute to the highly irregular surface topology in EB-PBF is the adhesion of unprocessed feedstock powder particles to the solid surfaces [30,95,102-104]. This phenomenon is caused by high-heat diffusion from the solid part to the surrounding feedstock powder,which is enough to partially melt powder particles.These particles then attach to solid surfaces and create the many round protuberances [41] that can be observed in Fig.8.The resulting irregularities are believed to contribute the most to the surface roughness of EB-PBF,and as such,this phenomenon is considered the dominant mechanism of roughness generation by some authors [105, 106].While particle adhesion is known to affect all surfaces,it seems to be more evident in overhang and down-facing surfaces 64]．The adhesion of powder particles is more severe in EB-based processes than in laser processes due to higher thermal radiation by the electron beam [17] and the preheating stages that sinter the powdered material around the solid part.\n\n![](images/14dc3f36e07b4afb1bf4fd100ce6024ce0da146c1f7050f93ad9ba2817be89a0.jpg)  \nFig.8.Partially melted feedstock particles and overflown material on lateral surfaces of Ti-6Al-4V by EB-PBF.",

    "content": "EB-PBF processes involve complex multi-physics interactions caused by the high-speed scanning and rapid material phase change [2,24].As such， the melt pool experiences different hydrodynamic effects throughout the melting and solidifying stages,giving shape to irregular surface structures of stochastic nature that contribute to the overall roughness [107].\n\nThermocapillary effects such as the Marangoni flow [1O8] can promote horizontal movement in the material inside the melt pool,and during the electron beam scanning,material tends to flow toward the edges of the scanned track leading to the formation of wavy structures on top surfaces [1O9].The turbulent hydrodynamic effects can be severe enough to make the melt pool overflow into the edges of the solid part [107],creating surface protrusions on lateral surfaces of EB-PBF parts as indicated in Fig.8.These structures created from overflow material have been identified by several authors in Ti-6Al-4V specimens,being sometimesreferred to as \"plate-pile\" stacking irregularities [31,41,110, 111].\n\nOther anomalies caused by melt pool instabilities and unoptimized process parameters can also produce surface defects that add to the irregular topology of EB-PBF parts.Porosity is a common defect in metal PBF processes and can be observed both in the bulk and on the surfaces of parts,with the latter constituting deep recesses on the surface [112]. Porosity in EB-PBF is attributed to lack-of-fusion phenomenon and to process deviations such as balling and particle spatter.Lack-of-fusion occurs when an insufficient energy density is provided to the powder bed during the electron beam scanning,leading to unmelted regions that form pores and voids [1l3,114]. However,if too much energy is provided,Plateau-Rayleigh instabilities can break the melt pool to reduce its surface energy, ejecting small sphere-like particles and also creating voids in EB-PBF parts [115-117].",

Smaller-sized powder particles have indeed been verified to produce better surface finishes on top and lateral surfaces in L-PBF [131,137].

After each reuse,Ti-6Al-4V powder particles became less spherical and more naturally rougher, becoming significantly distorted after the 16th and 2lst reuses [141-143].The particles also tend to cluster as they are repeatedly sintered together,and the recovery process with pressurized air can fracture these clustered particles,increasing the distortions that can affect the final roughness of parts [l4O].Yet, no surface roughness assessment has been made to verify the possible effect of highly reused Ti-6Al-4V powder.\n\nThe particle size distribution also determines the minimum layer thickness that can be used in a specific build [65,144],which affects the surface roughness in its own way,as will be described next.",

    "content": "# 5.2.Layer thickness\nLayer thickness,or layer height, is a process parameter common to all AM processes that define the physical thickness of each layer created ata time.Typical values for layer thickness in EB-PBF processes are 50 and $7 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ [119],above the $2 0 - 5 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ range of L-PBF processes [145, 146].Layer thickness is a major process parameter in metal PBF processes that affects many process variables,including build time,detail resolution in Z,generation of defects like porosity[145],and the surface quality.Regarding surface quality,layer thickness impacts the severity of the geometric deviations caused by the staircase effect: the thicker the layers,the more parts deviate from the original CAD geometry (Fig.7).\n\nMany authors associate the coarser surface finish of EB-PBF parts relative to L-PBF with the thicker layers used in EB processes [25,28,29, 97,135]. Korner et al.[1O7] verified through numerical simulations that increased layer thickness might also contribute to the surface roughness of EB-PBF as it facilitates melt pool movement and material overflow. Still,only a few studies experimentally investigated the influence of layer thickness on the roughness of lateral surfaces of Ti-6Al-4V parts.In a first study,Karlsson et al.[119] found no differences in the surface quality of builds with layer thicknesses of 50 and $7 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,although no measurement or characterization was performed -only comparison through SEM images.Later,Karlsson etal.[147] evaluated the roughness of lateral surfaces of Ti-6Al-4V specimens produced with 25 and $5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ layer thicknesses.The specimens showed a similar level of Ra roughness,although the authors claim that the overall surface quality of the lower layer thickness parts looked better in SEM micrographs.",

    "content": "In AM processes,build orientation refers to how parts are oriented inside the manufacturing chamber in relation to the build platform [1]. The build orientation of parts is defined prior to the manufacturing process and directly influences the total number of parts that can be fitted inside the build chamber.It also sets the maximum build height of each manufacturing run and, consequently, their build times [l27]. The build orientation was also verified to affect the part's microstructure and mechanical properties [1O4,111,148], its dimensional accuracy [101, 149],the manufacturability of small-scale features [15O],and the generation of lack-of-fusion defects [151]．The build orientation evidently defines how each surface of a part will be produced,either as a top or lateral surface - and for the latter,whether they will be facing upwards (upskin surfaces) or downwards (downskin surfaces),as illustrated in Fig.1Oa.It also determines the location,quantity,or even the necessity of support structures,thus having a substantial influence on the surface quality [97].It was mentioned that the roughness of top and lateral surfaces differ significantly,but upskin and downskin lateral surfaces also show distinct topologies and roughness levels.Table 2 summarizes some studies that analyzed the roughness of Ti-6Al-4V with EB-PBF in different orientations.Relatively large dispersion of Ra values can be noted across different studies for one specific surface orientation, and that is due to various factors,including the surface measurement methods utilized and process parameters utilized. Still,by comparing the results within same studies,it is possible to notice a discrepancy in Ravalues between vertical,upskin,and downskin lateral surfaces.",

    "content": "According to Galati et al.[76],the topology of upskin surfaces is dominated by the staircase effect and process deviation roughness.In terms of sloping angle,the authors verified a positive linear relationship between Ra/Sa roughness values and sloping angles for upskin surfaces. This means the roughness worsens with the increasing of sloping angles between upskin surfaces and the build platform.This outcome was explained by the different heat transfer effects the material experience during solidification. In upskin surfaces with low sloping angles,the just melted material has a larger surface area in contact with previous solid layers,and the solid body underneath acts as a heat sink that inhibit heat transfer to the surrounding powder particles [76].\n\nDownskin surfaces are often considered to be rougher than upskins, with surfaces dominated by partially melted particles adhered instead [40,64].These surfaces are built on unsupported regions,as shown in the diagram in Fig.1Ob.The effect of gravity on the melt pool in these unsupported areas can cause the melted material to sag into the powder bed below and create protrusions when the overflown material is solidified [18,152,153].Layer building over these unsupported regions also favors the heat transfer towards the sintered powder bed right below,causing more particles to partially melt and attach to the downskin surfaces [76].Regarding the inclination of downskin surfaces, Galati et al.[76] verified a negative linear relationship between Ra/Sa roughness and the sloping angle instead,with the more tilted surfaces showing the highest values. The lower the angle,the larger the unsupported regions and the heat transfer toward the powder bed below (Fig. 10b).\n\n![](images/6c1f7690fa3346d6048ab396057021a7a58aaae8e420b707a139a86cb7c945b0.jpg)  \nFig.10.(a) Surface orientation of PBF parts and (b) surfaces with different sloping angles.",

    "content": "Besides build orientation, the way parts are positioned and manufactured inside the build chamber can also affect the roughness generation in EB-PBF processes.The arrangement inside the build chamber can determine the total number of parts that can be fitted,ultimately impacting batch production times and unit cost.The position of parts in L-PBF processes has been proven to affect their final roughness due to the laser incidence spot deformation [154,155],the direction of inert gas flow,and recoater movement [156-158].\n\nAlthough these factors are not applicable to EB-PBF processes, there is evidence that the position of parts can influence the surface finish of Ti-6Al-4V parts.Borrelli et al.[1O1] noticed that parts produced at the four corners of the build platform consistently displayed slightly higher Ravalues than other parts,even more so in the surfaces facing the outward directions.These corner parts were built very close to the limits of the build platform,and the authors attribute this adverse behavior towards roughness to the less efficient heat dissipation of these regions. Their hypothesis was that heat was trapped in the narrow space between the solid part and the boundaries of the build chamber,inducing more powder particles to attach to the outward-facing surfaces [1O1].Galati et al.[77] and Kotzem et al.[159],also observed a similar tendency, especially in parts positioned closer to the EB-PBF equipment door.It is worth noting that the position of parts along the Z direction had no significant influence on surface roughness [101].\n\nYet, the relative position between Ti-6Al-4V parts inside the EB-PBF build chamber has been proven to afect their surface quality.

    "content": "The size and shape of the melt pool are determined,among other aspects [161],by the total amount of energy supplied by the energy source and absorbed by the powder bed,which in turn depends on interdependent and mutually interacting process parameters of the PBF process [1O2,146].For EB-PBF,in particular,the process parameters are dynamically controlled by a proprietary algorithm,making the study of individual parameters very challenging.For this reason, researchers rely on theoretical variables for calculating the total energy input levels. Among the most usual variables are the linear energy density [l26,162] and the volumetric energy density,the latter of which is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\ E _ { \\nu } = \\underbrace { \\begin{array} { l l l } { \\begin{array} { r l r } { P } & { { } } & { P } \\\\ { V _ { s } } & { { } \\times } & { H _ { s } \\times } \\end{array} } _ { t } } \\end{array}\n$$\n\nFor EB-PBF specifically, $P$ (W) is the power of the electron beam, $V _ { s }$ $\\mathrm { ( m m / s ) }$ the scanning speed of the electron beam, $H _ { s }$ (mm) the hatching space between scan lines,and t (mm) the layer thickness of the build. The electron beam power (P) is a function of both the accelerating voltage and the current, though it is controlled by the current (in mA) alone since the accelerating voltage is kept constant in EB-PBF equipment [162,l63].The hatching space is the physical distance between two adjacent tracks,and for EB-PBF processes,it is determined by the line offset parameter [9,l34].The scanning speed is the actual translational velocity of the electron beam and can be either dynamically controlled by the speed function parameter or be assigned a fixed value in manual control operation [l24].The layer thickness was already discussed in 5.2,and all these parameters are illustrated in Fig.11.",

    "content": "Another parameter closely related to the energy density input is the focus of the electron beam.The focus is controlled by a process parameter called focus offset,which is the current (in mA) that defocuses the electron beam from the sharpest calibrated position [162,164]. Defocusing the electron beam can sometimes enlarge the EB spot size up to a point but at the expense of producing shallower melt pools [165].It is worth noting that the EB spot size is ultimately controlled by a combination of the beam current and focus offset parameters through a non-linear relationship that is not disclosed by the EB-PBF equipment manufacturer [166].The energy density affects many aspects of EB-PBF parts since the size and temperature of the melt pool is known to influence the microstructure [127,l67], the chemical composition [168], and the porosity of Ti-6Al-4V parts [24,163].\n\n![](images/88e69df39dfd221ecf6cdd4cb0cec980e33d1344d6933f0dee5b49f706899213.jpg)  \nFig.11.Schematic of the electron beam and scanning strategy process variables.\n\nThe energy density also significantly affects the surface quality of top surfaces in EB-PBF with Ti-6Al-4V.Guo etal.[163] observed that lower energy density levels,achieved by reduced beam current and higher scanning speeds,lead to top surfaces dominated by cavities and lack-of-fusion pores.The authors claim that there was not enough energy to melt the whole powder region properly,and a gradual increase of the energy density with higher beam current values and slower scanning speeds produced much denser and smoother surfaces.Similar results were observed by Shrestha and Chou [1O9],in which the higher energy density levels obtained by only reducing the scan speed produced denser and flatter surfaces.",

    "content": "As mentioned in Section 4.3,the topology of top surfaces is dominated by wavy structures located at the edges of each melted track. Employing larger melt pools can re-melt some of these structures from adjacent scan tracks and improve these surfaces.Higher energy density levels elevate the melt pool's temperature and reduce its surface tension, increasing the width of the melt track [124] and benefiting the surface quality,but only up to a point.Excessive energy density can cause intense hydrodynamic instabilities in the melt pool, producing highly distorted structures on top surfaces [163] or,in extreme cases,leading to material vaporization that produces highly damaged top surfaces [8, 169].\n\nStill,using higher energy density levels can be a suitable strategy for roughness control on top surfaces,as verified by Prisco et al.[126] with Ti-6Al-4V specimens.According to the authors,besides reducing the scanning speed, increasing the focus offset values created a defocused beam spot large enough to re-melt the ridges of adjacent scan tracks. Another way of achieving these results is by reducing the distance between adjacent melting tracks through the line offset parameter [126, 134,168].This strategy induces scan tracks to overlap more while increasing the energy density as per Eq 1.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning the individual influence of parameters when the energy density is kept constant during the top surface melting. Silvestri etal.[l24] verified that using higher levels of beam current and or scanning speeds while maintaining the total energy density constant produced top surfaces with lower Sa roughness in Ti-6Al-4V specimens by EB-PBF.According to the authors,although the total amount of energy input is maintained,the thermal diffusion times are lower at higher scanning speeds,resulting in higher temperatures in the melt pool that are beneficial to surface roughness.",

    "content": "As for the lateral surfaces,the energy density also plays a central role in the surface quality EB-PBF with Ti-6Al-4V,but mostly due to partially melted particles.Increased energy density levels lead to thermal accumulation in parts and high-temperature gradients towards the surrounding powder bed region, thus enabling more particles to partially melt and adhere to surfaces [1O5,l66].This seems to be the case as either increasing the beam current and reducing the scan speeds [105, 125] or reducing the scanning speeds only [l26] resulted in rougher lateral surfaces in Ti-6Al-4V.On the other hand, the influence of the focus offset in the roughness of lateral surfaces showed mixed results with EB-PBF with Ti-6Al-4V.For Safdar et al.[1O5],decreasing the focus offset from $2 5 \\mathrm { m A }$ to $1 0 \\mathrm { m A }$ produced lateral surfaces with much higher roughness,which according to the authors is due to the concentrated electron beam that leads to higher energy densities.Prisco et al. [126], on the other hand,tested three differentlevels of focus offset-4,10,and $2 0 \\mathrm { m A }$ - that showed no influence on the surface roughness of lateral surfaces.\n\nItis also important to highlight the impact of energy density in the process deviation roughness by anomalies like balling. Yan et al.[170] verified through multi-physics modeling that the energy density from the electron beam must be sufficient enough to melt the solid substrate below the powder bed. Suppose the energy provided is only enough for the powder particles to melt or the melt pool is not as deep as to reach the layer below.The melted material would cluster into isolated agglomerates (balls) to reduce the surface energy,but according to the authors,a properly melted substrate should avoid the balling effect as the melted particles can spread to reduce the surface energy [170].",

    "content": "The scanning strategy of the melting process relates to the individual paths that the electron beam follows to purposely melt the powder and create solid layers.Fig.l2 exemplifies the melting of a single layer. This process is divided into two separate stages: the first involves melting the perimeters,which can be up to 5 concentric contour lines [1O].This stage is also known as contouring,and for EB-PBF processes,the default themes perform it with a spot melting strategy called Multibeam [3,127, 174,175]. This function is specific to EB-PBF processes since the translational speeds of electron beams are much higher when compared to lasers,allowing several melt pools to be simultaneously active.Unlike typical continuous fusion,in the Multibeam strategy the electron beam rapidly shifts between several points along a scanned track, promoting faster scanning and increasing productivity [176].It is also claimed that the smaller melt pools created by this strategy reduce the thermal gradient toward the surrounding powder and leads to better surface finishes [127,l76].However,a comparison between Multibeam and a continuous melting strategy for the contours performed by Wang et al. [125] showed that the non-multispot strategy was able to produce surfaces with lower Ra values for Ti-6Al-4V,though with the worst dimensional accuracy.The authors also verified that the parameters of the Multibeam function had some impact on the surface roughness on lateral surfaces of Ti-6Al-4V by EB-PBF,among them the number of beam spots,the spot time,and the distance between two consecutive spots.The number of spots determines the total number of active melt pools [56],and was the dominating factor in affecting roughness according to the authors,with a higher number of spots producing better-finished surfaces.",

Safdar et al. [105] state that thicker walls produced higher levels of Ra roughness in Ti-6Al-4V by EB-PBF.The authors claim that the increased energy required to melt these bulkier structures promoted more particles to partially melt and adhere to lateral surfaces partially.The results later observed by Razavi et al.[4O] and Karlsson et al.[l2O] contradict these findings,with the thin-walled specimens displaying the worst Ra roughness levels compared to the thicker ones,though with different thickness levels.Yet,more recent studies by Segersall et al.[178] showed that the part's thickness did not influence the roughness of Ti-6Al-4V specimens.More research on the matter is required to investigate further the role of geometry and wall-thickness in the surface roughness of EB-PBF parts.The influence of the powder size distribution and the layer thickness,although claimed by many authors as the main drivers of surface roughness generation in EB-PBF,still demand additional experimental evidence for the actual influence of these parameters to be established.The effects of the preheating stages should also be explored due to their role in surface roughness as explored in this review.With that said,the high costs associated with the EB-PBF equipment operation and the feedstock material can hinder experimental studies in the field.Numerical simulations have gained much traction over the past decade,including those to predict surface roughness [9].",

    "content": "# 7．Conclusion\nThis study reveals the growing effort by the academic community to better understand and correlate EB-PBF process variables with the surface roughness of Ti-6Al-4V parts,which also indicates the relevancy of this field of study.EB-PBF has already shown a great potential for industrial applications,and its inherent rough surface quality plays a central role,both positively and negatively.Yet,surface metrology for metallic PBF parts remains a very challenging task with the present measurement and characterization methods and techniques.\n\nPractical and experimental correlations are very challenging to establish in EB-PBF processes due to the highly interrelated process parameters and different measurement and characterization methods. Still, the main mechanisms behind surface roughness generation in EBPBF were reviewed,as well as the process variables and experimental correlations obtained for Ti-6Al-4V specifically.The opportunities for future research in the area were also covered,along with recommendations and guidelines that would allow the community to better interpret the results.\n\nOverall,the relationship between process variables and surface roughness of EB-PBF can better serve the purpose of comprehending the process rather than controlling the roughness entirely.To that end, surface finishing processes still present the best solution for fine roughness control, despite their many limitations regarding AM parts.\n\n# Funding\nThis study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil(CAPES)-Finance Code 001.\n\n# CRediT authorship contribution statement\nLucas C.B.

    "content": "Ti-6Al-4V is widely studied in additive manufacturing (AM),as it has broad applicability to aerospace [1,2]，biomedical [3,4]，marine, chemical and energy,and defense industries,due to its high mechanical strength,low density,corrosion resistance,and biocompatibility [1-6]. Ti-6Al-4V processed via AM is often reported to have higher strength but lower ductility than in traditionally processed conditions due to differences in microstructural features including $\\alpha$ -lath size,prior $\\cdot \\beta$ grain size/morphology，and defects [7,8]．The present study focuses on identifying relationships among different processing conditions,microstructures and defects,and mechanical properties in Ti-6Al-4V fabricated via laser power bed fusion (L-PBF) AM.\n\nL-PBF AMis a layer-by-layer process to fabricate three-dimensional components,where for each layer,the laser scans and melts powder in the pattern of the current 2D slice of the 3D component [5,6].Numerous parameters can have an impact on the structure,over several length scales,of the final component,including hatch spacing (the distance between parallel laser passes), $h$ ，powder layer thickness, $t ,$ laser power, P,and laser scanning velocity,v,[9],as well as other variables (e.g., parameters describing the beam source) that are closely related to the laser energyabsorptivity [1O,11].These parameters of $P , \\nu , h ,$ and tare typically reported in L-PBF studies that aim to correlate processing with structural features,such as defect morphology and grain/sub-grain features,as the variation of these parameters influences cooling rate and thermal history within components [6,9,l2,13].",

    "content": "Process maps can be used to identify combinations of parameters that result in certain features of interest.For example,Gockel and Beuth [14] introduced a process map of electron-beam power versus scan speed for electron beam wire feed AM process Ti-6Al-4V in which they defined boundaries separating different prior $\\cdot \\beta$ grain size and shapes based on estimated solidification modes,supporting the use of P-v process maps for microstructural control.Gordon etal.[9] extended the use of processing maps to delineate boundaries for different processing defects in L-PBF,and used synchrotron-based micro-tomography to characterize morphology of pores under a range of processing regimes, defining boundaries to differentiate lack of fusion (LOF) and keyholing defects [15].\n\nThe present study aimed to determine the four processing regimes that result in dense builds,and builds that contain defects due to LOF, keyholing,and beading-up.These regimes are accessed by different combinations of processing parameters that affect melt pool size and shape during processing [13]. The formation of both LOF and keyholing pores is directly related to the laser energy used,where irregularly shaped LOF defects appear with insufficient laser energy density and/or insufficient overlap between adjacent melt pools [l3].In contrast, keyhole pores appear when the energy density is high,resulting in a deep melt pool in which the molten metal may vaporize and leave behind trapped gas pores of a relatively round shape [12].While LOF and keyholing pores are typically discussed in terms of melt pool sizes, beading-up or balling is attributed to melt pool shape: if the melt pool is sufficiently elongated along the direction of laser scanning,then a Rayleigh-Plateau instability of the metallic fluid occurs due to surface tension,such that the long melt pool separates into multiple melt pools, resulting in bumps in the solidified material [16-18].",

    "content": "A total of 42 processing parameter sets,guided by various studies in literature [13,15,19],were designed to probe dense,keyholing,lack of fusion,and beading-up regimes in fabricated tensile specimens,to generate samples with varying defect structures,microstructures,and mechanical properties.To delineate different regions,boundaries can be defined based on two metrics:(1) laser energy density,which corresponds to melt pool size,and (2) laser power multiplied by scanning velocity,which corresponds to melt pool shape.Mathematical details on the process map design are given in Section 2.1.\n\nThe present study focuses on developing process maps for L-PBF Ti6Al-4V by experimentally identifying the impact of processing parameters on:(a） microstructure,in terms of prior $\\cdot \\beta$ grain size and morphology; (b) processing-related defects,in terms of frequency,volume fraction,and morphology;and (c） mechanical properties.The specimens were characterized using non-destructive X-ray computed tomography to obtain size,distribution,and morphological information on internal pores. Uniaxial tensile tests assessed ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation to failure of all samples.The microstructures of samples were imaged to characterize prior $\\cdot \\beta$ grain sizes and morphologies,and their Vickers microhardness values were measured.These data were used to construct processing-structure-property maps,and correlation analyses were performed to determine which processing descriptors,microstructural features,and mechanical properties were most strongly correlated in both dense samples and those with pores. Thus,in addition to providing comprehensive maps that show the effect of varying processing parameters on microstructure,including porosity, and mechanical properties,the statistical analyses presented in this study uncover the linear and nonlinear correlations among processing features,microstructural features,and mechanical properties.",

    "content": "To probe a range of processing regimes intended to produce a range of microstructures as well as dense samples and those with keyholing, lack of fusion,and beading-up defects,a process map was designed in which laser power and laser scan speed were varied for a constant layer thickness and hatch spacing. These four parameters are important to consider in processing maps because they each influence the total energyimparted by the laser to the powder bed.Specifically,the volumetric energy density(VED) is often used as metric for comparing L-PBF processing conditions [15,19,2O],and is expressed as:\n\n$$\nV E D = { \\frac { P } { h \\nu t } }\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm { \\bf P }$ is laser power, $\\mathbf { h }$ is hatch spacing, $\\mathbf { v }$ is laser scan speed,and t is layer thickness.\n\nIn addition to the volumetric energy density (VED),which approximates the laser penetration depth to be constant,and depends on a constant layer thickness,a modified energy density (MED) was also computed to consider the effect of laser power distribution and penetration depth.Ferro et al.[21] defined the MED by replacing the layer thickness with a variable penetration depth of the heat source penetration,with the MED given as:\n\n$$\nM E D = \\frac { \\beta } { h \\sqrt { 4 \\alpha \\phi } } \\bullet \\frac { P } { \\sqrt { \\nu } } = C \\bigg ( \\frac { P } { \\sqrt { \\nu } } \\bigg )\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is laser absorptivity, $\\beta$ is thermal diffusivity of the powder, $\\phi$ is the laser spot diameter,and C is a constant. These laser-powder interaction variables were approximated to be constant in the present study; thus,MED was taken to be proportional to laser power divided by square root of scanning speed.",

    "content": "Based on these energy density metrics,processing parameters (P,v,h and t) contribute to melt pool size,which can dictate the formation of processing defects. High power and low scan speed provide high energy densities,which may result in excess heat beyond the critical value for full melting and solidification of the powders,which in turn may cause overheating or the transition of the melt pool into a penetration keyhole regime.Lower energy density,in the case of low power and high speed, can easily give rise to the incomplete fusion,seen as LOF defect pores.\n\nThe Rosenthal equation [22] and its extend analytical solutions [23-25] are often used to describe the melt pool size and shape in terms of the heat source parameters and the powder properties.There are two main criteria to determine the transition between different processing regimes via variation in melt pool size and shape based ona combination of processing parameters.The details of each follow.\n\nPoirier and Geiger [23] and Adams [24] developed an equation for melt pool size by first solving for the temperature distribution as a function of distance from a moving heat source.By seting the temperature of interest, $T _ { i }$ ，to the melting temperature in the following expression,the melt pool size (described by the radial distance away from the heat source,r) as a function of linear energy density is given as:\n\n$$\nr ^ { 2 } = { \\frac { 2 \\epsilon } { e \\rho C _ { p } ( T - T _ { 0 } ) } } \\left( { \\frac { P } { \\nu } } \\right) \\quad { \\mathrm { a n d } } \\quad L E D \\quad = { \\frac { P } { \\nu } }\n$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is absorptivity, $e$ is Euler's number, $T _ { 0 }$ is room temperature, $T$ is set to the melting temperature to define melt pool size, $\\rho$ is material density, and $C _ { p }$ is thermal capacity. The linear energy density (LED) is defined as the energy provided per distance along the scanning path, which is the ratio of laser power to scan speed.",

    "content": "Based on Eq.(3), the size of the melt pool is proportional to the square root of linear energy density,which supports the usage of LED as a suitable metric to control the melt pool size.Several studies have used LED as the main processing feature with which to link density and mechanical properties of L-PBF Titanium alloys,through both experimental results [26,27] and statistical analyses [28].\n\nThe second criteria to describe the melt pool geometry and processing defect regime stems from examining the top surface of the melt pool during heat source motion. Researchers have shown that the square of the aspect ratio of the melt pool (length, $L$ ,over width, $w$ ）on the top surface of the powder bed is proportional to the product of heat source power and scan speed [23]:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac { L } { w } \\right) ^ { 2 } = \\frac { \\epsilon e } { 3 2 \\pi k \\alpha ( T - T _ { 0 } ) } ( P \\nu )\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is conductivity,and $\\alpha$ is thermal diffusivity.As the aspect ratio increases,the melt pool approaches or enters the beading-up regime. Gratzke et al.[25] attributed the beading-up regime in welding to the competition between surface tension and gravity that leads to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability,responsible for the breaking up of liquid jets.More recent research confirmed the prediction of the beading-up regime for metal L-PBF via both in situ process monitoring [29] and heat transfer simulations supplemented by experimental observations in",

Differences between the present study, which used a 3D Systems ProX DMP 32O,and studies in the literature that used an EOS M 29o L-PBF machine [13,15] may arise due to variations in other processing parameters that are not typically prescribed by users (e.g.，scan pattern,laser spot size),while here we also emphasize the fact that boundaries between defect and dense regions are approximate.The nonlinearity of the defect regime boundaries can be partially explained by the variation of laser penetration depth [21] and laser-powder interactions [47].Considering the MED criterion,the LOF-dense boundary was smoothed as the laser power P is proportional to the square root of scan speed v. However,for the dense-keyholing boundary, contours of constant modified energy density did not capture this transition. This can be partially explained by the fact that a significant increase in laser absorptivity has been observed in L-PBF when transitioning from dense to keyholing regimes [47].To identify processing-structure-property feature correlations for dense and porous samples in Section 3.4,we definea threshold of $^ { 1 \\% }$ porosity to delineate dense versus porous samples.",

    "content": "Unlike the Pearson's correlation method,which directly correlates the feature bivariate sets via linear regression,rank correlation methods interpret the ordinal sequences as input variables; hence,there are no limitations on the description of nonlinear trends,unlike linear regression.To address the ordinal association,two different correlation coefficients, Spearman's $\\rho$ and Kendall's $\\tau _ { \\cdot }$ ,were used in this study.The use of rank correlation methods alongside linear correlation methods provides complementary nonlinear descriptions for the process-structureproperty relationships,which is important to consider because catastrophic failure dominated by the presence of significant defects at porous regimes is nonlinear. This means that in dense samples, ductility may scale with porosity,while in samples with large pores,there is a sharp decrease in ductility with the introduction of irregular or large pores,leading to nonlinear behavior.\n\nThe correlation and difference matrices for Spearman's $\\rho$ and Kendall's $\\tau$ for dense and porous samples are shown in Fig.11.Few differences can be found between the two rank correlation methods.The Spearman's $\\rho$ resulted in slightly higheraverage correlation values $( \\rho =$ 0.45 and O.29 for dense and porous samples,respectively) than the Kendall's $\\tau$ $( \\tau = 0 . 3 4$ and 0.22 for dense and porous samples,respectively)when averagingall bivariate pairs,with an average increase of $3 1 \\%$ in the coefficients.This suggests that the Spearman's $\\rho$ may be more sensitive than Kendall's $\\tau$ to evaluate the nonlinear feature correlation relationships found in this work.Thus,further discussions in this section focuses solely on Spearman's $\\rho$ as the primary nonlinear correlation parameter.",

    "content": "Abstract: Additive manufacturing is a rapidly developing manufacturing technology of great potential for applications. One of the merits of AM is that the microstructure of manufactured materials can be actively controlled to meet engineering requirements. In this work, three types of Ti-6Al-4V (TC4) materials with different porosities are manufactured using selective laser melting using different printing parameters. Their dynamic behaviors are then studied by planar impact experiments based on the fre-surface velocity measurements and shock-recovery characterizations. Experimental results indicate that the porosity significantly affects their dynamic response,including not only the yield, but also spall behaviors. With the increasing porosity, the Hugoniot elastic limit and spall strength decrease monotonically. In the case of TC4 of a large porosity, itbehaves similar to energy-absorbing materials, in which the voids collpse under shock compression and then the spallation takes place.\n\nKeywords: additive manufacturing; Ti-6Al-4V; dynamic behaviors; porosity; spall",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM) technology has a series of technical advantages such as rapid prototyping, free manufacturing, and high material utilization, thus showing great development potentials and broad application prospects in automation industry [1,2], aerospace [3,4], shipbuilding, biotechnology [5], automobile [6], parts processing [7], and other fields [8,9]. Several critical reviews regarding AM technological innovation processes have been published [10-13]. Recently, AM technology has shown one advantage which is even more attractive-that is, it can actively manipulate the microstructure of materials by adjusting printing parameters and strategies, such that some unique and excellent mechanical properties could be designed for specific applications. For example,AM components with special microstructures such as honeycomb and gradient can significantly improve heat transfer and anti-collision performance [9,14].\n\nIn many engineering cases, the mechanical properties of materials under dynamic loading are of importance and have been approved to be sensitive to the internal microstructure [15-17]. Therefore, there is an urgent demand to employ AM technology to control the microstructures, and then to manipulate the macroscopic dynamic properties of materials. By far, only a few works are available to study the dynamic response of AM materials, especially on the effect of porosity produced during printing. For instance, Valdez et al. induced various levels of porosity in Super Alloy 718 by modifying the powder bed fusion process including laser power, scan velocity, and hatch spacing,and then investigated their dynamic behaviors [18,19]. Their results show that, in the presence of high porosity, porous materials perform much like open-cell foams and are highly sensitive to densification.",

    "content": "Branch et al. demonstrated shock wave modulation or \"spatially graded-flow\" in shock wave experiments via controlling AM techniques at the micron scale by using time-resolved X-ray imaging [20]. Gangireddy et al. discovered that porous sandwich Ti-6Al-4V (TC4) AM samples exhibited greater energy absorption per unit volume than fully dense samples using split-Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) testing [21]. However, there is still a lack of systematic understanding of the effect of porosity on the dynamic mechanical properties of AM materials.\n\nIn order to better understand the effect of porosity on the dynamic response, in this work, we prepare three TC4 specimens of different porosities by using different printing parameters in the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process and then carry out a series of planar impact experiments to investigate their dynamic behaviors. Results demonstrate that dynamic mechanical properties, including the Hugoniot elastic limit and spall strength, are significantly affected by the porosity. A small difference in porosity could remarkably reduce the dynamic properties. Depending on the porosity, the materials may present a good energy absorption capability.",

Continuous grain boundaries are observed in three band-contrast images,as marked by the red dotted line shown in the right column of Figure 2 [28,29].\n\nThe acoustic velocities (longitudinal wave velocity, $C _ { L } ,$ and shear wave velocity, $C _ { s }$ of each sample are determined by using the pulse-echo method, respectively. Then, the bulk sound velocity, $C _ { 0 } ,$ is calculated by\n\n$$\nC _ { 0 } = \\sqrt { C _ { L } ^ { 2 } - \\frac { 4 } { 3 } C _ { s } ^ { 2 } }\n$$\n\nAll these results are listed in Table 2.\n\nFigure 3 presents the sample textures. It shows that the samples represent a stronger texture in the {100} orientation than that of {110} and {111} orientations. The maximum texture intensities of T1, T2,and T3 samples observed in the {100} orientation are 42.85, 32.13,and 59.18, respectively, indicating that T3 has the most concentrated texture. This is because the change in printing parameters leads to different cooling rates and grain growth mechanisms, resulting in different grain orientations and texture intensities [30].\n\n![](images/865a93c8665fd1d303a4e53ab6e19f68a94eaf8aebecf656692aa7ba13f02c97.jpg)  \nFigure 3.Pole figure maps of SLM Ti-6Al-4V materials studied.",

    "content": "where $\\Delta u _ { f s }$ is the difference of the free surface velocity from the peak value to the first minima,as indicated in Figure 5. The calculated results are shown in Figure 6b. This demonstrates that, although the porosity difference between the two samples is only $0 . 5 9 \\%$ the difference in the spall strength is more than $2 5 \\%$ . Therefore, the porosity produced during printing significantly affects the dynamic response, including both the yield and spall behaviors. Compared with wrought TC4 $( 5 . 2 8 \\mathrm { G P a } )$ [22], the spall strength of SLM TC4 is much smaller. The degradation in the spall strength might be due to the combined contrition of the pores and microstructure. It is well known that the microstructures of SLM and wrought materials could be remarkably different. In this work, however, it is impossible to identify which is playing the dominant role.\n\nFor sample T3, the free-surface velocity profile is extremely different from that of samples T1 and T2. The free-surface velocity increases gradually and no shock wave is formed. This is due to the compaction of numerous voids under dynamic compression. Note that, at the impact velocity of $5 0 0 \\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { s }$ , the peak free-surface velocity is remarkably lower than that of the samples T1 and T2, while at $6 2 0 \\mathrm { m } / s$ the peak velocity is almost the same as the ones in samples T1 and T2. It thus suggests that the voids in the sample T3 are completely compacted and the sample becomes dense at higher shock pressure.",

    "content": "The Hugoniot elastic limit and spal strength of the sample T3, as shown in Figure 6, are calculated by using Equations (2) and (3), respectively. Results demonstrate that, as expected,both $\\sigma _ { H E L }$ and $\\sigma _ { s p a l l }$ of the sample T3 are further lowered due to the large porosity. Based on the above comparison, it is concluded that the increase in porosity markedly reduces the Hugoniot elastic limit and spal strength of SLM TC4 materials, thus degrading their mechanical performance.\n\nJones et al. have also investigated the spall strength of SLM TC4 [22]. In the case of the loading direction parallel to the printing one which is the same as us, SLM TC4 samples had the spall strengths of $3 . 0 3 \\mathrm { G P a }$ and $3 . 3 4 \\mathrm { G P a }$ at the impact velocities of $3 1 0 \\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { s }$ and $4 1 5 \\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { s } ,$ , respectively.

    "content": "To further understand the dynamic behaviors of shocked materials, shock-recovered samples were characterized by using OM, as shown in Figure 7. At the impact velocity of $5 0 0 \\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { s }$ , no cracks are visible in sample T1, while in the samples T2 and T3 there exist obvious isolated cracks. Some cracks have rounded tips, suggesting the coalescence of voids [34,35]. Such an observation is somehow inconsistent with the observed velocity profiles in which the spallation occurs in the samples T1 and T2. We atribute this inconsistency to the incomplete spallation in sample $\\mathrm { T 1 }$ because it has a higher resistance to dynamic tension than the samples T2 and T3 as indexed by the spall strength. In the sample T3 recovered, the collapse of voids is clearly observed, providing direct evidence for the shock-driven compaction. At the impact velocity of $6 2 0 \\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { s }$ complete spallation takes place in all three samples, thus obvious spallation damages are visible. In the sample T1, a large number of small cracks with a length of less than $5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ locate at the zone with a width of $2 7 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . While in the samples T2 and T3, the damage region expands significantly, suggesting that cracks originate from widely distributed voids.\n\n![](images/f3e342ad5296b5e969a7b22e6a5e81f0acf6e9dda195a91cbc248763d05d537f.jpg)  \nFigure 7.

    "content": "# 4. Conclusions\nWe have printed TC4 materials with diferent porosities by designing the printer parameters and experimentally investigated the effect of porosity on the dynamic response of SLM TC4 materials. Experimental results indicate that:\n\nSLM TC4 with different porosities show observably different dynamic characteristics in the free-surface particle velocity profiles. The increase in porosity significantly degrades the dynamic mechanical properties, including the Hugoniot elastic limit and the spall strength. . Dense samples show better tensile-resistant properties than porous samples, while porous samples show a good energy absorption capability than dense samples. Shock-recovery characterizations indicate that, in porous samples, void collapse and energy absorption occur in the impact stage and cracks mainly originate from widely distributed voids.\n\nTherefore, materials with various dynamic properties can be produced by selecting certain printing parameters. This work may guide AM technology to design materials for certain applications under extreme conditions.\n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.H.; methodology, Z.L.; validation, Y.C., Z.J. and J.C.; formal analysis, Z.L., L.H. and Y.C.; investigation, Y.C.; resources, J.H.; writing-original draft preparation, Y.C.; writing-review and editing, Z.L. and J.H.; project administration,J.H. and Z.L.; funding acquisition, J.H. and Z.L.

    "content": "Due to rapid production,high materials utilization rate and flexibility in forming complex shapes,additive manufacturing (AM) has gained considerable attention compared with the other fabrication technologies such as casting,forging,powdermetallurgy,spark plasma sintering,and hot press [1-5].In several AM technologies,selective laser melting (SLM) is regarded as the most promising method for fabricating parts with intricate structures due to its high manufacturing precision.In addition,rapid solidification processing also makes the microstructure of SLM-ed samples finer and more homogeneous,which results in excellent mechanical properties [6-9].Due to their characteristics of high specific strength,remarkable thermal stability,and excellent biocompatibility,titanium(Ti) and its alloys are widely used in the fields of aerospace,defense,marine,and biomedical.[10-15]. Considering the advantages of SLM technology,lots of Ti-based alloys, such as pure Ti, Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-Ta, Ti-Nb-Zr, Ti-Nb-Zr-Sn,are fabricated and studied recently [16-26].",

    "content": "In general, spherical powder is recommended as the raw material for the SLM process due to its high flowability,which is usually produced by either gas atomization (GA) or electrode induction melting-gas atomization (EIGA)[1].Nevertheless,the fine spherical powders used for SLM are not cost-effective.Compared with atomized spherical powders, irregular hydrogenated dehydrogenated (HDH) powders are finegrained and cost-effective.However,low flowability inhibits their extensive applications for SLM.In order to meet the SLM process requirements，ball milling technology was used to improve the morphology of irregular HDH powder by our group previously [27].Ball milling is a technology that usually was used to modify the morphology of powders [28-32].After ball milling of $4 \\mathrm { h }$ ,the particles become nearspherical with no obvious angularity,and the powders have optimal flowability with the tap density of $2 . { \\dot { 1 0 } } { \\mathrm { g } } / { \\mathrm { c m } } ^ { 3 }$ and Carr's index of 77.74, which meet the SLM process requirements [32]. The modified powders were then used to fabricate the samples,and fully dense sample could be obtained using this kind of powder.In addition,compared with the samples using spherical powder,the samples fabricated using the modified powder exhibited higher strength and elongation,which were $8 7 6 . 1 \\pm 2 0 . 5$ MPa and $1 4 . 7 \\% \\pm 0 . 5 \\%$ ,respectively [4,19,27].\n\n![](images/a9076140fab1fb54c4672c9eb17b7e1e10fdc5a02b58d00618d69ae3a522e3c8.jpg)  \nFig.1.Morpolitrtioofowdereeilg:(apowrs)alildoers(c)rtio\n\nTable 1 Raw and milled powder properties and impurity element content.

For instance,Wysocki [34] fabricated the high-performance commercially pure Ti (CP-Ti) through adjusting the process parameters,and the fracture strength of fabricated samples was nearly1.7 times of ASTM B265-15 Grade 3 CP-Ti while the elongation was basically the same.As mentioned fore,the modified low-cost near-spherical Ti powders could meet the requirements of SLM,but the powder characteristics,such as morphology，apparent density are different from spherical powders. This can lead to different laser absorption rates and refractive rates of powder bed.Thus,a different set of SLM process parameters may be required to obtain optimized mechanical properties.Consequently,it is worth investigating the effects of SLM process parameters on the microstructure and mechanical properties of SLM-ed Ti parts using modified HDH-Ti powders.\n\nIn this paper, the influences of process parameters on the singletracks,microstructure,mechanical properties of Ti parts fabricated by SLM using modified HDH-Ti powder were investigated systematically. The aim is to obtain the optimized SLM process parameters for fabricating high-performance CP-Ti using low-cost modified HDH-Ti powder. This will also help in promoting applications of low-cost SLM-ed CP-Ti parts in the different engineering fields.",

In every layer,the quality of the single-tracks melts pool influences the layer directly and hence,is evaluated firstly in this study.Laser power and scanning speed,as two major processing parameters of SLM,significantly affect the quality of the single-tracks melt pool.Hence,a $4 \\times 4$ orthogonal experiment, as presented in Table 2,was designed to study the influence of these two parameters on the molten pool.\n\nFig.2 presents SEM micrographs of single-tracks with different laser beam powers and scan speeds.As can be seen, the pool width increased gradually with the decrease of scan speed from $1 2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ to $3 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ and increase of laser power from 75 W to 225 W.When the scan speed and laser power were $3 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } / s$ and 225 W,respectively, the width of the pool reached the value highest of $3 7 4 . 1 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (Fig.2(b)). The increase in the width of the pool was mainly related to the linear energy density (LED).At a constant scanning speed,the LED increases with laser power. On the contrary,ata constant laser powder,the LED decreases with scan speed.The higher LED leads to a higher temperature of the molten pool, which leads to melting of more powder and hence,increases the width of the molten pool.",

    "content": "Additionally,a continuous single-tracks molten pool with fish-scale characteristics can be formed at low laser power or high laser power with low scan speed (Fig. 2(a). It is worth noting that balling caused by Plateau-Rayleigh instability was not formed with a low laser power of 75 W.This is mainly caused by powder laser absorptivity.By testing, the laserabsorptivity of modified powderis O.71,which is higher significantly than that of spherical powder (O.6) [38].The higher laser absorptivity can inhibit balling formed as even at low energy input.When the laser power is $2 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { W }$ and scan speed is in the range of 6oo-1200 $\\mathbf { m m } / s _ { \\mathrm { i } }$ ,the surfaces of the single-tracks showed arc-shaped protrusions and balling,as marked by the yellow circle and red arrow in Fig.2(a).

    "content": "where m, kB,T and $\\sigma$ are the atomic mass,Boltzmann constant (J/K), molten pool temperature (K),and surface tension of the liquid $\\mathrm { ( N / m ) }$ respectively.At a constant scanning speed, the energy received by the molten pool increased with laser power increasing,leading to an increase in the temperature of the molten pool. From the formula (l),it can be seen that any increase in temperature of the molten pool leads to reduced $\\mu$ [39,40].In addition,as the constant of laser power, the increase in scanning speed gives rise to the increase of temperature gradient in the molten pool [39].This induces a high gradient of surface tension in the molten pool with a high scanning speed,and resultant Marangoni convection [5,39]. The formation of such convection increases the thermocapillary force and resulting in the instability of molten pool [5]．Consequently,the higher scanning speed means stronger Marangoni convection and greater thermocapillary force within molten pool,which reduces the stability of the molten pool significantly [41-45].Taken together,the combined influence of the decrease in $\\mu ,$ the strengthen Marangoni convection and the enhancement thermocapillary force increased the instability of the molten pool and hence,formed arc-shaped protrusions and balling.Thus,when the laser power reaches 225 W and scan speed is in the range of 6oo-1200 $\\mathrm { m m } / s$ ，an instable molten pool forms,resulting in arc-shaped protrusions and balling.",

Nevertheless,as shown in Fig.4(b),compared with that of the raw powders,XRD patterns in the small 20 angles range exhibited that the exact 20 locations of the diffraction peaks of all samples had a slight deviation.Lattice parameters of a and c of four samples calculated by XRD were $0 . 2 9 3 4 2 \\mathrm { n m }$ and $0 . 4 6 7 9 6 \\mathrm { n m }$ ,respectively.Thisagreedwith the values in previous study given for $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ phase $\\mathtt { \\Omega } = 0 . 2 9 3 1 3 \\mathrm { { n m } }$ and ${ \\mathfrak { c } } =$ $0 . 4 6 8 1 3 \\mathrm { n m }$ [27,33,48]. Thus, the phase formed in samples A,B, C,and D was the $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ phase.This was mainly related to the SLM process.In the SLM process,there is a very high heating/cooling rate $( 1 0 ^ { 3 } – 1 0 ^ { 8 } ~ \\mathrm { K } / \\ s )$ which leads to the non-equilibrium $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ phase formation.\n\nTable 4 Process parameters for the relative density of fabricated parts greater than $9 9 \\%$   \n\n<table><tr><td>Sample number</td><td>P/ W</td><td>v/ mm/s</td><td>h/ mm</td><td>dint/ um</td><td>Relative density /%</td><td>LED / J/m</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>175</td><td>600</td><td>0.09</td><td>122.54</td><td>99.64</td><td>291.7</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>125</td><td>300</td><td>0.15</td><td>68.49</td><td>99.57</td><td>416.6</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>175</td><td>300</td><td>0.12</td><td>156.01</td><td>99.51</td><td>583.3</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>225</td><td>300</td><td>0.18</td><td>163.97</td><td>99.48</td><td>750</td></tr></table>\n\n![](images/c393e9624605e9921f2751c9e1631cc80c757dfd9e227e466c25b802cee40191.jpg)  \nFig.3.The relative density of bulk parts (a)and the relationship between significant depth and relative density (b).",

It can be seen that all samples were close to full density.The microstructure of all samples can be characterized by the acicular $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ phase,and there was no significant difference except for grain size.The grain size of samples A,B,C,D was compared in Fig.6.It should be noted that the width and length of the grain size of four samples were in the range of $2 . 1 1 - 5 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and $1 3 . 5 \\mathrm { - } 3 0 . 9 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,respectively.Among them, the grain size of sample A was the finest with a width of $2 . 1 1 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and length of $1 3 . 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ 、This was mainly related to the LED.The LED of samples A, B, C,and D was $2 9 1 . 7 \\mathrm { J / m }$ $4 1 6 . 6 \\mathrm { J / m }$ $5 8 3 . 3 \\mathrm { J / m }$ $7 5 0 \\mathrm { J / m } ,$ respectively.Decreasing LED reduces the accumulation of heat inside the molten pool.This enhances the thermal gradient,which in turn increases the thermodynamic and kinetic undercooling of the molten pool, resulting in an increase of the solidification rate [5,39].The increased solidification rate results in forming finer $\\beta$ grain (the initial grain of the $\\alpha ^ { \\ast }$ phase transformation),and hence can form finer $\\alpha ^ { \\ast }$ phase. In addition, the grain growth was inhibited due to the increase in cooling rate during the process of the $\\beta$ phase transforms to martensitic $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ phase [5].Taken together,compared with other samples,sample A with higher solidification rate exhibits the finest grain.",

In general, the difference on the mechanical properties of fully dense Ti component mainly relate to grain size,interstitial element content,dislocation density and phase composition [9].In this study,four samples showed similar interstitial element content as the same level.In addition,based on the Williamson-Hall theory, the dislocation density of SLM-ed parts with different LED ranged from 2.41 to $2 . 6 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 5 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ ,and has no significant difference [8,9].Hence, the excellent mechanical property mainly attributed to the phase and grain size.The microstructure of four samples consisted of martensitic $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ phase,which had higher hardness than the $\\alpha$ phase.In addition, the finer grain size of CP-Ti also improved the properties.As mentioned before,the lower the LED,the finer grain size.Compared with spherical powders,the modified powders had a higher laser absorptivity,which results in lower energy input to obtain the densified Ti parts and hence exhibited a finer grain size [50].",

Noticeably,the mechanical properties of CP-Ti parts fabricated in this study even exceed the ASTMB265-15 Ti-6Al-4Valloy level.The reason for the excellent performance of the SLM-ed part using modified HDH powders in this study is mainly due to the process optimization,which resulted in full acicular $\\alpha ^ { \\ast }$ phase microstructure with fine grain size in the fabricated parts.As a result, this study further improved the mechanical properties of CP-Ti fabricated by SLMusing low-cost modified HDH-Ti powder through process optimization.This outcome not only establishes optimized process windows for SLM-ed parts using modified low-cost HDH powders but also can facilitate in developing of CP-Ti parts in different engineering fields.\n\n![](images/48d6affde6f20a765344bcc591ade14ff9d9f91cd5f3ba6adeeaad5489844d43.jpg)  \nFig.8.

    "content": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing (AM is a digital manufacturing process that produces complex metallic components with excellent mechanical properties owing to the grain structure and reduction in phase segregation under rapid solidification [1-3]. The “as-built”LPBF parts often exhibit rough surfaces [4],requiring additional post-processing steps to achieve a desired surface finish [5]:this increases lead time and development cost. Many post-processing methods,including heat treatment [6],hot isotropic pressing [7],ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification [6]，advanced finishing machining [8] and laser polishing [9],have been used to improve the surface finish and eliminate residual stresses in “as-built”components [10].Roughness control on AM parts is vital as surface roughness has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the end-user applications, e.g.controlled roughness can promote bond formation between implants and the human body[11,l2],whereas surface irregularities can lead to wear or reduction in fatigue life and consequently lower the part performance [13].\n\nThe surface finish of the AM part is governed by process parameters (e.g.laser power,scan speed,hatch distance,and layer thickness,etc.) and materials parameters (e.g. optical and thermophysical properties)\n\n[14,15].In general, the surface roughness decreases with increasing laser power $( P )$ and reducing scan speed (v) [14,16,17]. Conversely, lower heat input or linear energy density $( \\mathrm { L E D } = P / \\nu )$ applied to the powder bed leads to a colder and more viscous melt pool, promotes poor wetting behaviour [14]，and results in balling-like features and increased surface roughness [18].These prior studies predominantly studied LED ranges from 0.1 to $1 . 5 \\ : \\mathrm { J m m } ^ { - 1 }$ [14,18,19].",

    "content": "Several characterisation techniques have been used to quantify the surface roughness of AM components, including optical microscopy [20],scanning electron microscopy (SEM) [19],atomic force microscopy [21],coherence scanning interferometry (CSI) [14],and hyperspectral imaging [22].None of these techniques can study the built topology on a layer-by-layer basis;therefore,the underlying mechanisms in which both geometrical properties and individual powder layer thickness contribute to the final build part remain unclear.Analysing the interlayer roughness and quantifying the underlying mechanisms would provide further insight to achieve optimum as-built surface quality.\n\nEngineering surface textures are split into three key profiles: roughness,waviness,and nominal profile [23].Roughness refers to micro-scaled asperities of the build surface,also known as fine textures [24].Fine textures are usually generated by the laser beam melting or sintering of powder particles [25].Roughness parameters are measured commonly ina two-dimensional form (2D) and they are typically used to dictate the overall surface roughness topology [26].Amplitude parameters are commonly used to describe the surface topology by quantifying the vertical surface deviation with respect to a centre line [27]. $R _ { a } ,$ the average surface roughness,is also known as the arithmetic average of the profile height deviation from the centre line,i.e.,the mean height which indicates the overall surface texture [28]. Surface waviness describes the periodic oscillations induced by the melt pool behaviour [29]: it usually increases with a decrease in surface roughness. Lastly, the nominal profile is described as a combination of the roughness and waviness profile.",

    "content": "To produce high-quality AM parts,in situ monitoring can help achieve the desired surface texture [2O,3O].In situ optical and thermographic imaging studies focus on surface roughness at the final build layer which does not reveal the interlayer mechanisms thatlead to some types of surface roughness [31,32].New analysis methods are required to understand both final build layer and interlayer relationships.To characterise surface roughness fora multilayer build, various statistical parameters should be used such as average roughness $\\left( R _ { a } \\right)$ ,root mean square (RMS),and skewness (Sk) [24,26],which in return provides a feedback system for monitoring surface roughness through parameter control as demonstrated by ref.[26].\n\nSynchrotron radiation enables X-ray imaging to offer unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution [33]. Several research groups have used in situ X-ray imaging to study process dynamics during multilayer LPBF [30,34,35] but have not discussed the underlying mechanisms involved in surface roughness variations under multilayer conditions.The first multilayer X-ray imaging study of LPBF [34] revealed that a thick powder layer could increase spatter,whereas a thin powder layer could lead to laser remelting,forming a smoother track surface.\n\nRecent work shows that increasing the imparted specific energy, SE (esed beam diameter, reduces surface roughness and increases waviness [37]. The resultant surface topology of an AM track is linked to the hump formation owing to the combination of Plateau-Rayleigh and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.The variations in $\\nu$ and $P$ under overhang conditions also impact the laser energy transferred to the powder particles, thus having a direct influence on the melt pool size and wetting mechanisms which lead to balling phenomena by reducing laser power and scan speed.",

Denoising allowed a clearer segmentation between the melt track,background (argon),and powder.After that, Otsu thresholding was applied to the denoised image to segment the background and melt track [49] (Fig.lb-c).We used the binarised image to calculate the built height by adding all the pixels in the build direction along the track length forming a track profile using a MATLAB script [5O] (Fig.1di).

Using synchrotron X-ray imaging,we captured the lapping evolution mechanism during LPBF.Fig. 4a shows a radiograph of a thin-wall build after the lOth layer,wherein the light grey lines at the ends of the track are labelled as lapping.The grey scale values indicate how much energy has been attenuated along the X-ray beam path: the lighter the pixel,the less energy is being attenuated by the object and darker pixels indicate higher attenuation.\n\nThe radiograph (Fig. 4a-i), optical (Fig.4b),and XCT 3D rendering images (Fig.4c) confirm the presence of sintered powder between the overlapping tracks.The in situ X-ray images (Fig.4d-g) have allowed us to capture,for the first time,how a lapping defect is formed under a multilayerLPBF process.Firstly,the layer thickness increases by powder accumulation at the edge of the previously solidified structure: this alters the build condition from remelting to an overhang build condition (Fig.4d).At the onset of the melting process,the effective thermal conductivity of the Ti-6Al-4V reduces up to $9 0 \\%$ [61]: this promotes the formation of balling or melt pool curl-up on the accumulated powder [39] (see Fig.4e).The liquid metal may overflow,wet onto the solidified structure below,and subsequently trap powder particles whilst merging with the solidified part.In other words,the powder particles are sandwiched by two scan tracks above and below,forming the lapping defect (Fig.4f).As the laser beam continues to move from right to left,the layer thickness is reduced from $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to none,indicating significant remelting and promoting a large volume of melt flowing towards the end of the track, such that the added material warps or budges upwards as it cools.

Conclusions\nThis study used in situ synchrotron X-ray imaging to investigate the evolution of the interlayer side-skin roughness and waviness and associated defect formation mechanisms during LPBF of TI-6Al-4V multilayer builds.The findings were supported by ex situ optical imaging and XCT results.A novel surface topology matrix was developed to describe surface features and defect formation mechanisms while effectively representing the overall geometrical build morphology and texture.The matrix can be used to find the desired surface finish and achieve better surface control under a layer-by-layer processing during LPBF.The following conclusions have been drawn:\n\n1.Two key mechanisms were observed that affected the side-skin roughness and amplitude: (1) $R _ { a }$ decreased between an LED range of $0 . 5 { - } 1 ~ \\mathrm { J m m ^ { - 1 } }$ ,due to a decreasing melt pool size ratio where the surface became smoother due to Plateau-Rayleigh and KevinHelmholtz instabilities and (2) $R _ { a }$ increased between a LED range of $1 { - } 4 \\ \\mathrm { J m m } ^ { - 1 }$ as metal vaporisation was more severe due to an unstable keyhole melting mode. An optimal $R _ { a }$ of $1 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ was found to be at an LED of ${ \\sim } 1 ~ \\mathrm { J m m ^ { - 1 } }$ ：\n\n2.Using synchrotron X-ray imaging we observed the defect dynamics during LPBF and quantified their effects on each of the printed track quality.We found that defects that occur at: (1) LED range of 0.5-0.6 $\\mathrm { J m m } ^ { - 1 }$ include lack of fusion, spatter, balling and track interruption, which increase $R _ { a ; }$ and (2) that regardless of the process parameter for LPBF printing,the single bi-directional multilayer printing lead to the formation of,lapping and humping defects, which also increasing $R _ { a }$",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM) of metal is one of the most desirable but also stochastic manufacturing processes [1,2].Due to the high flexibility of AM processes and intricately designed,mass customized or even individualized components can be manufactured ina shorter time compared to traditional manufacturing processes [3,4].Liu et al.[5] mentioned that since the development of selective laser melting (SLM),a special powder bed AM process for the production of metal parts, extensive research was conducted to develop high quality products considering the manufacturing parameters.The manufacturing parameters mainly include the environmental conditions of the processing chamber,the laser processing parameters,and their combination strategy [6,7]. Several researchers found that the combination of laser processing parameters is not arbitrary in terms of the required energy input and significantly affects quality [8].\n\nThe laser processing parameters are the laser power, the scanning speed and the hatch spacing.But the diameter of the laser focus also plays a decisive role in melting the material. The energy density (ED) of the impact area mainly depends on these laser processing parameters, while some researchers also consider layer thickness as a parameter of the ED [9].In addition, the laser scanning strategies,such as scan patterns and repeated scanning of the same layer (re-melting) have also been addressed to observe their influences.These manufacturing conditions can be used to manipulate the properties of the SLM product, such as density，porosity，and microstructure,which ultimately contribute to the mechanical and chemical properties [10].",

[11] reported that the surface quality and strain can be improved by remelting strategy for Ti-5Al-2.5Sn alloy.Yu etal.[12] studied the remelting effects on $1 7 { - } 4 ~ \\mathrm { P H }$ stainless steel during laser metal deposition.They observed that the strain is limited due to the interlayer defects,which can be reduced with increased ED during re-melting. Vaithilingam et al.[13] observed that the chemical composition of the surface of Ti-6Al-4V products changed with the second scanning,where the concentration of Al and V increased.Lv et al.[14] worked on the elimination of pores of Ti-6Al-4V by in situ re-melting and found that the scanning speed can control the porosity.However,the above articles are based on the re-melting strategies,which show that it is possible to regulate the metallurgical properties of Ti-6Al-4V in the SLM process in ways other than the single scanning.",

    "content": "Titanium alloys such as Ti-6Al-4V are attractive alloy systems in terms of the favorable combination of high strength-to-mass ratio and biocompatibility,including corrosion resistance [15,l6].Due to these advantageous properties,a wide application of Ti-6Al-4V can be observed in the automotive,aerospace,marine,and chemical industries [17].It is also used extensively in biomedical implants such as orthopaedic (knee,hip,shoulder),maxillofacial (skull,mandible),dental and other implants [1,l8].However, there are numerous disadvantages to manufacturing titanium alloy products using conventional methods due to the high hardness,chemical affinity,melting point, volumetric specific heat,and low thermal conductivity of titanium. These disadvantages in conventional manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V alloy products can be overcome by AM technologies,such as SLM[19].\n\nMuch research was done to achieve the desired quality of Ti-6Al-4V alloy products fabricated by SLM,considering the different laser processing parameters and their different scanning strategies.Ultimately, achieving the desired product quality is still challenging considering all the mechanical and chemical properties.Even though re-melting layers require additional time and energy，researchers are investigating possible re-melting strategies given the process to improve product quality.Therefore,in this work,the influences of repeated scanning of the same layer, consisting of pre-melting with an effective lower ED and subsequent re-melting with several higher EDs,on the quality of Ti-6Al4Valloy products in the SLM process were investigated.",

    "content": "Notable porosity features were observed in the samples, which may help to investigate the reason for the density differences.Similarly,insights can be gained into the phenomena that occurred during the interaction between the laser and the metal powder,including their effects on the melting process and the properties of the melt pool. The porosity differed between the contour and core regions of a sample. Fig.4 shows the SEM images of the contour regions ( $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ inside from the vertical surface) of the cubic samples,where an exposed region followed the scanned layers successively along the build-up direction. The contour region contains a small number of tiny pores,while the core region consists of many pores.Although the overall porosity of the samples ranges from $1 . 6 1 ~ \\%$ to $3 . 7 6 ~ \\%$ ，the number of pores in the contour region is very small, with some regions containing no pores. Moreover, these pores are tiny compared to the pores that usually occur in the SLM process for Ti-6Al-4V[14,2O],and the defective regions are also small.Therefore,re-melting in the contour region resulted in significantly lower porosity and other defects forall samples manufactured by different parameters.\n\nFig.5 shows that the pores are very small and irregularly shaped. Their size ranges from a few micrometers to $3 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ in length/width/ diameter. The tiny pores are formed by the keyhole effect,as shown in Fig.5(b),or by the entrapment of gas bubbles,as shown in 5(h). Insuficient melting or bonding between layers/tracks,on the other hand,has resulted in large pores with small widths,as shown in Fig. 5 (d).Some almost spherical pores with high irregularity were observed, possibly due to small spattering of material or insufficient melting,as shown in Fig.5(f).However, Figs. 4 and 5 together show the melting characteristics of the surface,where good melting and bonding also occurred.",

    "content": "The pores in Fig.5 also represent the highest possible phenomena of pore formation in the production of a sample with the corresponding manufacturing parameters. Sample 1,which was manufactured at the highest scanning speed,was most likely to collapse the keyhole and form a keyhole pore [23],as shown in Fig.5(a). Samples 1 and 2 were highly likely to leave pores with unmelted region as they were manufactured with low ED.They also had a high scanning speed,which meant lower thermal stability and a high cooling rate.Therefore,the melt was not able to occupy all the required sites,especially in the lower region between two melt pools belonging to two consecutive tracks [24],as shown in Fig.5(c).Increased ED in sample 3 causing the onset of spattering of the melt [1O],as shown in Fig.5(e).As the laser power was very low in sample 4,the viscosity of the melt pool was low.Therefore, there was a high probability that the gaseous bubbles were trapped [4]. The gaseous bubbles normally enter the melt pool from the spaces between the particles.However,they flow with the vortex,as shown in Fig.5(g), and as the melt pool solidifies from bottom to top,the vortex becomes correspondingly smaller.The gaseous bubbles also flow with the vortex and move upwards.Then they move away from the melt pool or remain on the upper region and mix into the next uppwer layer during scanning.\n\n![](images/dc6a7578c287c6a192207cb7043a18472edc6765c88966efcbac5494ae4c8011.jpg)  \nFig.4.Contour areas of (a) sample 1,(b) sample 2,(c) sample 3,(d) sample 4,and (e) sample 5.\n\n![](images/56920e2b564e28e735169978d21e2b7792015bdaad90c299ee1a04da626acc97.jpg)  \nFig. spaterngales",

Similarly,no alignment of pores is observed in sample 3.Only some small spherical pores are seen in sample 3.Subsequently,a significant decrease in laser power and scanning speed while keeping ED the same as in sample 3 resulted in a higher porosity with a vertical pore alignment,as shown in Fig.6(d). However,in sample 4,some additional pores are out of alignment.\n\nFurther increase in laser power and scanning speed with the higher overlap of tracks while keeping ED the same resulted in a higher number of pores in sample 5.A larger number of out-of-alignment pores can be observed in sample 5 than in sample 4.

    "content": "The vertically aligned pores on the vertical planes (XZ and YZ) result from the absence of melting.The absence of melting occurred between two underlying parts of two melt pools,as shown in Fig.8(a) labeled “unmelted zone\".Here,the melt pools belong to two successive scanning tracks.Therefore,these pores had the potential to extend continuously parallel to the scanning tracks in a layer.However,they were interrupted by the peak regions of the melt pools in the previous layer that were re-melted.Fig.8(b) depicts this phenomenon,where the unmelted height is lower than the peak regions of the melt pools of the previous layer.A valley section between two successive melt pools remained an unmelted area. Thus,the unmelted zone remained at the junctions of the melt pools of two successive layers rotated by $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ ,leaving these horizontally extended pores,as shown in Fig.8(d),a top view of one layer.If the peak of a melt pool of the previous layer was not high enough, the unmelted zone continued and remained as a longer extended pore,as two of them marked in Fig.7(a).\n\nSince the scanning tracks change by $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ in each successive layer, the unmelted track is not visible in the same plane in the next layer. Therefore,these pores can be visible after about two layers,as shown in Fig.8(c),since the unmelted zone remained in the lower part of one layer.One of these two layers belongs to the same layer of the unmelted zone,and the other belongs to the next layer.Similarly,the pores in each of the two successive layers appeared in the same position and produced a vertical alignment of the pores.\n\n![](images/2d09712331ad6d86e562996a9716c9c5c808f441df02ffa3d522174900351b7a.jpg)  \nFigeso aoeseed layer-by-layer build-up direction and scan directions for successive layers.\n\n![](images/b84764faa4b0bff1e707c17be84ba27869a8c126967b57af76f049a14cea6116.jpg)  \nig.7slle ndicate the pores’alignment in a layer placed next to the pore lines.",

Other rays penetrate the powder layer and are reflected several times by several particles and finally scattered. The powder particles eventually absorb these laser rays as thermal energy [8]. Since the laser power was low and the scanning speed was high during the initial scanning of a layer, only a small amount of laser energy was induced, resulting in a small ED that allowed partial melting of the particles.Therefore,these materials formed some spheres that clumped some adjacent particles by the balling mechanism,as schematically shown in Fig. 9(b),or the particles sintered,as shown in Fig.9(c),or a mixture of both.\n\n![](images/9592953645cc8d3d4cd4c14e4ac13c03cf2265d696c12b0385a1356f18135be0.jpg)  \nFig.9.Reelaoeia laeaedl withig fspereflop microstructure,(h) the sphere is not molten at all and contains only cellular microstructure.",

    "content": "The initial scanning and fusing process formed a roof on the top of the layer,as shown in Fig.9(c).The successive large spheres allowed less area between them for the laser beams during the second scanning. On the other hand, the sintered particles formed a roof with higher number of pores where the large spheres were less.This roof also allowed a small number of laser rays to penetrate the layer during the second scanning. Most of the rays were reflected from the top of the layer in both conditions,as shown in Fig.9(d).The amount of laser penetration depended on the laser power,scanning speed,and the presence of holes in the roof. The extent of laser penetration increased while the laser power increased and the scanning speed decreases.However,less ray penetration was not able to melt the large sphere.Finally,it remained as a sphere with little connection to the surrounding metal, as schematically shown in Fig.9(e).An example of this type of unmelted sphere in the sample is shown in Fig.9(f).This balling effect with a diameter of about $2 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ was observed on samples 1,2,4,and 5.This balling effect was also observed on the vertical surface of sample 3,which means that the balls in this sample were well melted due to the high ED with high laser power.",

Eventually,this unmelted area extended parallel and adjacent to a track. The adjacent next track also left the unmelted zone connected to the previous unmelted zone,which together formed a larger pore with intertwined shapes.This unmelted track is sometimes interrupted by the peak areas of the melt pool of the preceding layer.The peak area varies slightly in a sample due to the physical properties of the melt pool formation.It should be noted that the peak area does not vary significantly with the variation of the process parameters and ED due to the fixed layer thickness.Therefore,the pores (belonging to the defined alignment) varied by the size laterally of the melt pool and by the melting properties,including the viscosity.",

This resulted in fewer rays penetrating the layer, forming smaller melt pools with high viscosity and keeping the unmelted zones.To produce sample 5,the scanning speed was higher than sample 4,but more moderate and lower than sample 3.Therefore,amoderatelyincreased laser power provided higher intensity,and simultaneously the overlap of the tracks was also higher.These three parameters were sufficient to allow penetration of a significant amount of rays,resulting in explosions of trapped gases and metal vapour within the layer [26].These explosions caused material to be ejected from the action zone,causing it to lose material and heat.The melt pool belonging to the next layer could not reach those unmelted zones.Therefore,the spattering of materials created large pores in sample 5,which can be seen in Fig.6(e) in the vertical plane and Fig.7(e) in the horizontal plane.",

These particles were removed during the grinding and polishing of the cross-sectional surfaces.However, sample 5 lost material due to spattering,significantly reducing its density.Moreover,the metal spheres formed by the balling effect have the cellular microstructure near the circumferential regions and the planar/ cellular microstructure in the core regions,as shown in Fig.9(f)-(h).

    "content": "Significant differences were noted between the specimens in surface morphology.They also significantly differ from the parts produced by the regular single scanning method in SLM[29].However, three sides of the surface morphologies were studied, namely the bottom,the vertical, and the top surface.The bottom surfaces of the samples are afected by the problem of starting layers because the starting layers are built on the support bars.The gaps between the support bars were filled with powder particles. Some of these particles became associated with the melt pool, and some of them stuck to the bottom of the melt pool.This phenomenon occurred twice,once during the first scan and the other during the second,with increased ED.The bottom surface,comprising the first few layers from the beginning of layering of the cubic samples,was represented in Fig.1O by SEM images of the vertical cross-sectional plane.\n\nIt is known that a remarkable problem occurs in the production of some layers above the supporting bars and the hanging areas [29]. The melt pools of the first layer were unstable due to the lack of solid support underneath,and they accumulated excessive powder particles.This circumstance ensured the melt pool could move downwards at the gap between the supporting beams.The powder accumulations were caused by the penetration of the laser rays into the previous layer and the adhesion of the powder particles to the bottom of the melt pool.In addition, the powder particles were blown out from the front and side areas during the laser progression due to the high heat generation.This resulted in a lack of material,eventually leading to pores,as shown in Fig.1l(a). On the other hand,a large amount of material was obtained in some areas and a large volume melt pool was formed,as shown in Fig.1l(b).The large pores at the starting layers occurred mainly at the beginning of the experiment, such as sample 1, followed by sample 2 at an increasing rate.",

    "content": "These circumstances occurred during the scanning of the first layer, while a few next layers were affected by these circumstances.The low ED in sample 1 could not melt well enough to contribute to molten metal flowing and covering the pore areas.In addition,the high scan speed did not provide enough time for the material to flow into the pores.However,the pore areas lacked material,so they suffered from the excess heat energy that led to the melting of the particles under the layer.These events occurred at the sample site up to several layers due to the high heat generation,bowl creation,gas explosion,powder spattering,and spattering of molten metal. This event caused an extension of melting below the first layer,as shown in Fig.11(a),with the “extended melting\" marker.The depth of this extended melting corresponded to some layer thicknesses.The elevated ED covered these pores in sample 3, but these occurrences resulted in several large expansions below the first layer,as shown in Fig.11(b).These expansions ranged from tens of micrometers to $3 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$\n\nNevertheless, scanning speed significantly influenced surface morphologies in the present study.A slower scan speed resulted in higher timing of melt pool stabilization,which caused neighboring particles to partially melt and attach to the bottom surfaces of the melt pools. Consequently,a lower number of powder particles adhered to sample 1, which was produced at a high scanning speed during the second scanning.Therefore,the bottom of sample 1 has a small amplitude deviation, as shown in Fig.1O(a).This effect was also influenced by the applied ED, whereby it was lowest in sample1of all samples.The low ED generated the smallest melt pools and affected the surrounding powders the least, as the heat transfer to the neighboring particles was low.",

    "content": "In comparing the samples,the first layer of sample 4 was not fused well in several places and was greatly expanded in some places,as shown in Fig.1O(d).This was due to the strong impact of the laser beams with the low laser power and scanning speed. Several locations were not well fused due to the low laser power and roof formation. These roofs were also broken in some places due to the explosion during the second scanning,and therefore large flaws occurred in these places.Since the scanning speed was the slowest,a large portion of the laser beam penetrated the roof hole areas.The penetrated rays were reflected several times and reached deeperunder the first layer due to the lack of absorption.Therefore,these rays melted the powder under the layer and bonded them together.Finally, they formed the extended melting areas up to $4 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ ,containinga high amount of adherent powder particles. Therefore,they would be difficult to remove from the inner regions of the scaffold product.\n\nComparatively shorter expansion occurred at the bottom of sample 5, as shown in Fig.1O(e).Although the laser power was increased slightly, the scanning speed increased comparatively more in sample 5,as the ED remained the same as in sample 4 with the help of a larger track overlapping.The higher track overlap did not contribute to higher penetration of the laser ray.Therefore,the bottom of sample 5 did not extend significantly,resulting in the least fluctuation and fewer particles adhering to the bottom surface compared to the other samples in this study.",

The surface texture properties were affected by the volume of the melt pool,which was clearly influenced by the active ED.The shape of the melt pool was varied by viscosity and the involvement of infiltrated and adherent particles [30,31].",

On the other hand, the microstructure of a partially melted particle consists of a cellular microstructure in the circumferential region,as shown in Fig.1O(f).

In addition,a significantly slower scanning speed allowed a longer time for heat conduction to the adherent particles, eventually leading to a higher melting ability.The significantly increased ED melted many adjacent powder particles,drawing them into the melt pool with the help of sufficient surface tension and viscosity.

These thermal challenges resulted in a difference in shrinkage between the core and surface regions.The core region shrank faster than its surface,which is on the opposite side of the sample surface.This stress eventually caused several cracks on the ball's surface.Some balls were not melted during the next layer scanning inside the sample due to their high volume,as shown in Fig.9(f).However,if the ball,especially the cracks,are not well melted, the ball and its cracks will remain in the sample,which will deteriorate the product's mechanical properties.",

Similarly,the melt pools were well connected for sample 3,which was made with the highest ED.Although the ED was high for sample 4,the laser power was much lower,resulting in insufficient penetration of the laser to produce large melt pools.Therefore,gaps remained between the tracks in several places,although the adjacent track could be connected in some places,and the size of the pores between the tracks was significantly reduced.For example,in sample 4,several pores disappeared between the tracks as shown in Fig.13(d).In sample 5,more pores disappeared between the tracks due to the higher laser power and larger overlap of the tracks.Finally,sample 3 was irradiated with the highest laser power among the samples prepared with the same ED, resulting in the smoothest surface with almost no pores.\n\nThe pores on the tracks are clearly presented in Fig.17.Several mechanisms are involved in the formation of these pores,namely the absence of material due to stacking and spattering of materials [35].As shown in Fig.17(a), the absence of material on the track is also possible during the first scan due to aggregation and balling effect.During the second scan,the surface tension in the melt pool and the contraction force during cooling are the reasons for the appearance of these pores as shown in Fig.17(c) and (d). The large pore,as shown in Fig.17(a),was formed due to lack of material as well as a small stacking of material forming a mounded zone.The lower part of the pore area melted well with a smaller volume of material and with the same ED.The stacked or mounded zone was scanned after the pore area, resulting in a larger pore space with high cohesive force and clumping.",

    "content": "Asthe temperature rises,the coefficient of viscosity of a liquid decreases because the internal coefficient of friction between the molecules decreases.At a higher temperature,the molecules move apart and lose cohesive force,causing the coeficient of friction to decrease.At a higher ED,the temperature increased,and as a result, the viscosity of the molten pool decreases.Thererfore,the low ED resulted in high viscosity in the melt pools of sample 1[17].The high viscosity together with the high surface tension,hindered the driving forces against the viscous drag forces [36]. Therefore, the molten material could not spread and flatten efficiently in the available time.This phenomenon shaped the track as bumpy and small stacked zones of sample 1.\n\nIncreased ED in sample 2 moderated the viscosity of the melt pool, allowing the material to stack behind the pool. This resulted in several large material stacking zones,next to which a pore can be observed,as one of them is shown in Fig.17(b).There is also a possibility that a ball exists in the same location marked as a stacking zone,which was created during the first scanning.In the second scanning,the laser could not focus well on the pore area that existed along the scanning direction behind the ball.Therefore,a small area did not melt well, while after this area,the material melted and pulled a little material from the shadow zone[3].The same effects are observed in sample 5,as presented in Fig.17(f).The effective ED was almost the same as the laser power in sample 5 and was lower than that in sample 2.As for the previously seen spattered pores inside sample 5,there was a high probability of the occurrence of pores due to material spattering on the top surface and one of them is presented in Fig.17(e).Therefore,no stacking zones were observed adjacent to these pores.",

    "content": "i.Density may not be improved and may even deteriorate when the re-scan strategy is used.The laser may not penetrate sufficiently into the target layer during the second scan because the laser is reflected from the top of the layer.Therefore,the calculated volumetric energy density would not be applicable in the second scan.   \nii.The results show that melting during the second scanning is possible if the ED is high enough to completely melt the layer. Furthermore,high laser power is required to achieve sufficient penetration of the laser rays.So while the laser power decreased while the ED remained high,the porosity increased.   \niii.Although a high ED melted the layer well when re-melted,the surface acquired a complicated morphology as the powder particles were induced a second time and partially melted.In addition,reducing the laser power resulted in less adhesion of the powder particles and thus a less complicated morphology.   \niv.Massive spattering of molten metal occurred while the hatch spacing decreased due to overheating in the overlap zone, although the ED was the same. Although the same hatch spacing resulted in higher product density ( $1 0 0 \\%$ relative density) when used for single scanning.   \nv.

    "content": "vi.With a suitable remelting strategy,different surface textures can becreated,ranging froma remarkably smooth or bumpy surface to ahighly porous surface.A combination of laser parameters resulted ina very smooth top surface,but also a very intricate surface with high roughness in the contour and bottom areas.   \nvii. Re-melting with high energy density and high laser power provided the complicated surface structures with internal spaces on the bottom and vertical surfaces that allow good osseointegration for implant fabrication and increase the current density for metal electrode batteries.   \nviii. Due to the sintering of the powder particles and the subsequent melting,a high number of balling effects occurred.The spheres were larger than $2 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ ，while the layer thickness was $2 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ They did not mix with the other molten metal and remained with cellular and planar microstructures without $\\alpha ^ { \\ast }$ -martensite. Therefore,they deteriorated the yield strength and possibly increased the ductility.\n\nThis study has helped to reveal the pores and other mechanisms of defect formation especially in Ti-6Al-4V alloys.The implications of this study have created an awareness of the problems that will occur in most cases when using the re-melting strategy in SLM.",

However, moving from these bespoke applications to high-volume commercial manufacturing requires higher levels of predictability and control of part properties.Detailed simulations of the LPBF processcan assist this transition by providing understanding of defect mechanisms and guiding paths to improvement.An accurate value of laser absorptivity for the material is critical for LPBF simulation but the published literature contains surprisingly little absorptivity data applicable to actual LPBF operating conditions. Here we determine the in-situ laser absorptivity of the alloy Ti-6Al-4V during LPBF to be $0 . 2 7 + / \\mathrm { - } \\ 0 . 0 3$ fora laser wavelength of $1 . 0 7 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ . Our technique involves calibrating melt pool CFD simulations against single-track experiments conducted over arange of energy densities and can be extended to other materials.The simulations incorporate multiple laser reflections and cover the transition from conduction to keyhole mode.We also discuss physical mechanisms that may be responsible for changes in the absorption behaviour at high laser energy density which are observed in this and other work.",

    "content": "Metal additive manufacturing (AM) refers to the creation of parts by adding material ina layer-wise and selective fashion to build the desired 3D geometry.Within each layer,an intense energy source (laser,electron beam or electric arc) moves along a CAD-derived path to melt metal powder or wire,which then solidifies before the next layer is deposited. The advantages of AM for the production of metal parts are well known. Geometries with a complexity impossible by subtractive methods can be achieved and AMoffers the design flexibility foradvanced applications like functionally graded compositions and meta-materials.Tooling,part post-processing and material wastage are all reduced.However, although AM is used extensively for aerospace applications and for medical implants,the broader rate of adoption by high-volume commercial manufacturers has been slow.The main concerns have been variable part quality and a low level of predictability of the part microstructure and mechanical properties.These problems stem from the relatively poor understanding and control of the complex physical processes involved.Simulation of the various AM production methods can greatly assist in this regard.",

    "content": "The methodology and applications of AM simulations are described in many reviews,for example [l-4].Most work has focused on three areas:the behaviour of the melt pool which forms where the laser or electron beam strikes the workpiece,the microstructure which develops during solidification and cooling,and the overall part distortion and stress distribution.Modelling studies linked to experiments have provided valuable insights into the fundamental factors controlling melt pool dynamics,keyhole instabilities,dendrite growth and grain development. Simulations have also helped clarify thecausesof manufacturing defects like baling, lack of fusion between build layers, pore formation, spatter, surface roughness and excessive part distortion. The majority of these simulation investigations,though,have been of a qualitative nature,examining mechanisms and trends with limited experimental validation.More quantitative predictions can enable selection of the best production settings [5],assist part quality certification[6] and,eventually,directly improve part quality by linking machine process control to concurrent simulation [1].",

    "content": "The ultimate simulation goal is an all-encompassing ‘digital twin' of the AM process [7] which operates at multiple scales from microstructure to whole part distortion,with integrated material properties and bidirectional coupling between sub-models [2]. Since the pool of molten metal which forms during AM is key to the whole process,an accurate description of this region is essential if such digital twins are to produce reliable predictions.The sophistication of the underlying physics in melt pool simulation has advanced considerably in recent years to encompass the effects of powder particle size distribution,melt circulation and free surface dynamics,metal vaporisation,surface tension variation and vapour recoil.Nevertheless, simulation accuracy remains fundamentally reliant on knowledge of the dozens of material and process parameters which influence the final part properties and quality to varying degrees. Arguably, the most important process variable is the rate of heat transfer to the part from the energy source,usually a laser or electron beam. This heating rate directly affects the melt volume,track dimensions and local temperature histories,and therefore the subsequent microstructure, residual stress and distortion.For laser powder bed fusion (LPBF),as considered in the current work,heat transfer to the part depends on the fraction of the incident laser power that is absorbed by the metal, rather than reflected.The fraction absorbed at a particular location is a material parameter known as the‘absorptivity'.The material absorptivity is a critical parameter in LPBF which exerts a first order effect on most aspects of part production.",

    "content": "Here we determine the laser absorptivity of Ti-6Al-4V during LPBF. We employ a novel method which involves combining single track LPBF experimental data with detailed simulations.Crucially,our approach yields the values during actual LPBF operating conditions.Absorptivity values are normally measured in laboratory conditions,requiring specially designed apparatus.The advantages of obtaining absorptivity data in-situ become clearer after some background concerning absorptivity behaviour and measurement methods.\n\nIn LPBF,the apparent absorptivity (fraction of laser power transferred to the part) can be increased by extraneous contributions from multiple laser reflections and vapour plume absorption,as discussed later.We refer to this quantity as the ‘effective'absorptivity to distinguish it from the ‘intrinsic'absorptivity which is determined just by the intrinsic (bulk) properties of the material. (Note absorptivity is not truly an intrinsic quantity as it also depends on the external radiant flux.) The intrinsic absorptivity of metals depends strongly on many factors such as the light's wavelength,angle of incidence and polarisation,and the material's temperature,roughness,oxidation and other contamination [8].",

For randomly polarised light, the angular dependence follows an intermediate ‘average'curve which typically exhibits a maximum at the Brewster angle,this angle varying with wavelength but in the range from 60 to $8 0 ^ { \\circ }$ for most metals at room temperature [8,9].   \n· The composition (e.g.,contamination) of the material surface also strongly affects the absorptivity.For Ti-6Al-4V,a surface oxide layer forms rapidly from any oxygen or water vapour in the atmosphere [10] and can change (generally increase) absorptivity by $5 0 ~ \\%$ or more [11,12] with continued exposure.   \n·Surface roughness is yet another important factor.The intrinsic absorptivity is defined for (and normally measured on) highly polished surfaces.However,if the surface roughness increases to a scale similar to or larger than the laser wavelength,reflections between protrusions significantly increase the apparent absorptivity [13]. Strictly speaking,roughness is a geometric rather than intrinsic property.However, in practice it is virtually impossible to separate its influence so poorly characterised surface roughness affects many",

    "content": "Considering all the above complexities,absorptivity values obtained in conditions which reflect the actual process are essential for accurate simulation.For Ti-6Al-4V, the subject of the current work,very little of the considerable body of published absorptivity data meets this requirement for LPBF.For the LPBF process,the laser beam is unpolarised with an angle of incidence generally close to $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ ,except when approaching keyhole mode as discussed later in this work.The wavelength of the predominant LPBF laser types (Yb-fiber at $1 . 0 7 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and Nd: YAG at $1 . 0 6 4 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ is significantly different to the $1 0 . 6 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ of the $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ lasers often used in other processes like welding.Even more importantly,it is now well-established (for example[1,l5]) that in LPBF the laser beam primarily strikes molten rather than solid material,apart from at the start of laser tracks.However, the high-temperature absorptivity data published for Ti-6Al-4V[11,12,16-27] are mostly restricted to the solid state which has limited relevance to LPBF since a decrease in absorptivity of $\\sim 3 0 \\%$ occurs from the solid to liquid state [20]. The data vary over a wide range,from about O.2 to O.8,due to the various factors described earlier such as wavelength,temperature and oxidation level. They are also restricted to angles (specific values $6 5 ^ { \\circ }$ [24], $7 8 ^ { \\circ }$ [23], $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ [11,12,16,17,19-22,26], hemispherical averages [18]) and wavelengths (specified [11,12,16,17,20-22,26], band averages [18,19,23,24]) which are mostly ill-matched to the typical LPBF conditions noted earlier.In summary,therefore,we are not aware of any measurements of Ti-6Al-4V laser absorptivity which are adequate for accurate LPBF melt pool simulation.",

    "content": "1.The absorptivity of metal surfaces can be obtained from emission data since emissivity and absorptivity are equal in practice.The most common technique to obtain directional emissivity from a solid Ti6Al-4V surface has been to combine the radiance value from narrow-band pyrometry with thermocouple measurements to obtain emissivity viaPlanck's Law[12,19,22,24].Other techniques tested include an emissivity reference paint (found to be unsuitable [24]) and a InGaAs photodiode detector,used ina study of the effects of oxidation on the emissivity of solid Ti-6Al-4V surfaces [11].Reports of emissivity measurements from molten Ti-6Al-4V surfaces are scarce.Lisiecki [26] investigated the effect of nitriding on melt emissivity by pyrometry,with only relative results possible due to the experimental difficulties. Just two groups have obtained absolute emissivity data for molten Ti-6Al-4V,both by applying rapid electrical pulse heating to wire and measuring during the brief period before the wire collapses.The first group,Cezairliyan et al.[17], measured radiance by pyrometry and calculated emissivity by assuming that a radiance plateau immediately before wire failure corresponded to melt at the liquidus temperature.Boivineau et al. [20] employed the most sophisticated technique;measuring the phase change of a polarised laser beam after reflection to directly calculate emissivity via the Fresnel equations,and then combining this emissivity with pyrometer measurements to determine surface temperature. All of these laboratory approaches are subject to significant error from various factors such as extrapolating temperatures in a dynamic environment, thermocouple inaccuracy, changing surface oxidation and unwanted background radiation sources [11,19,24]. Uncertainties of $2 0 ~ \\%$ or more remain in even the most carefully controlled experiments [24].",

    "content": "Additionally,none of the above emission techniques are readily transferable to LPBF conditions as the higher temperatures can be expected to further increase measurement error and also create new problems such as vapour coating of delicate optics and thermocouple breakdown [24].\n\nAn alternative to measuring emission is to directly calculate absorptivity from the fraction of laser power absorbed by a sample.This approach has the attraction of being more robust in LPBF conditions, although still requiring a purpose-built laboratory rig. For Ti-6Al-4V, the technique was first attempted by Keller et al.[21] and subsequently refined by others [25].Laser tracks are run across an insulated sample which contains two thermocouples located at different distances from the top surface.The laser stops at time $\\mathbf { t } _ { 1 }$ and the sample starts to cool.After around $^ { 1 0 \\ s , }$ ，the two thermocouple readings converge,and it is inferred that the entire sample has equilibrated to a uniform temperature.The subsequent rate of sample heat loss,as measured by the thermocouples,is used to extrapolate backwards to the initial enthalpy at time $\\mathbf { t } _ { 1 }$ .Knowing the laser power and duration,the fraction of laser energy absorbed can be calculated.However, this fraction may be under-estimated as there is an implicit assumption that heat losses by long-term convective cooling dominate those from the immediate melt pool region (radiation,enhanced convection,energy lost with vapour).The fraction only constitutes an effective absorptivity rather than the intrinsic material property since it is increased by melt pool reflections,for example,and is also an average over the whole period of laser heating rather than instantaneous.This calorimetric method therefore does not yield absolute values,although providing very useful trend information concerning absorptivity behaviour.",

    "content": "3.A third technique is to measure the total backscattered light with an integrating sphere radiometer,yielding the nett sample absorption by subtraction from the laser power.The corresponding absorptivity is again an effective rather than intrinsic quantity as it includes energy transferred by multiple laser reflections and vapour plume absorption[28]． Side-by-side experimental comparisonswith calorimetry [29,3O] and co-axial monitoring of melt pool emission [31] indicate that the backscattering approach can be more accurate. However,this requires painstaking processes to calibrate radiometer sensitivity (by prior measurements with a gold target),account for ambient light and determine various backscattering losses (to the laser beam head and through openings such as the entrance port). Spatter from the melt pool also necessitates occasional recoating of the $\\mathrm { B a S O _ { 4 } }$ lining of the radiometer to maintain full reflectivity. Despite these difficulties,backscattering systems offer the considerable benefit of providing the effective absorptivity in real-time,as exemplified by fascinating comparisons with simultaneous highspeed X-ray imaging [27].",

    "content": "In summary,the prospects to obtain melt absorptivity data from laboratory measurements which are both accurate and applicable to LPBF appear poor,and in-situ measurements during LPBF require complex equipment and analysis.Here,we determine the melt absorptivity bya different approach based on simulations calibrated by LPBF experiments.Laboratory methods all replace the actual LPBF conditions with some simplified arrangement in which analytic equations (particularly Planck's law and 1D heat conduction) become reasonable approximations. Such experiments are very difficult to construct and control,as explained above,and can miss important influences on the desired property.In contrast,by calibrating simulations against LPBF data obtained during actual operating conditions,any effects on absorptivity like surface roughness,oxidation and elevated temperatures are automatically encompassed.A hurdle for LPBF simulation has always been the complexity of the underlying physical equations but this is no longer a barrier with the latest CFD codes [3].As we demonstrate, providing the model is accurate and other contributing parameters are well-known, the material absorptivity can be obtained by calibration of the model against experimental data.",

Some other groups have used simulation to obtain a laser absorptivity during LPBF but their methods (applied to Inconel) relied on a single track [32,33] or omitted melt flow influences [34,35]．By contrast, the approach reported here involves calibration over a range of experimental conditions with a full CFD calculation,and is further strengthened by including HAZ as well as fusion data.The next section describes the LPBF experiments and the calibration data obtained. Sections 3 and 4 provide details of the simulation methodology and the absorptivity calibration process.Finally, Section 5 discusses the implications of the laser absorptivity results,including interesting trends observed at higher laser energy densities.",

This melt concavity is typical behaviour during LPBF and caused by the Marangoni-driven surface flow,plus recoil from surface evaporation when laser conditions are more intense.Presentation of the melt circulation pattern seen in the results is omitted here for brevity, being somewhat peripheral to laser absorptivity measurement and similar to those described in great detail by many authors,for example [48].\n\nFig.5(b) plots the Maximum Temperature results for the same analysis.The key point to note is that the Maximum Temperature contours become constant within a short distance of laser travel, reflecting the fact that the melt pool itself quickly reaches a steady state condition.

    "content": "Having established the simulation method,the next step was to run a series of analyses to calibrate the absorptivity value.After some iteration,an absorptivity of O.32 was found to give a reasonable match of the simulated fusion and HAZ dimensions with the experimental data,as plotted in Figs.7 and 8.As a guide, the dashed lines show where the data points would lie in the hypothetical case of a perfect match.That ideal is, of course,not realised due to both simulation error and experimental variability.However,considering that all material properties are fixed and only one global parameter is varied to fit four different experimental measures, the overall agreement is considered very good. The final step was to refine this initial estimate of O.32 for absorptivity,as described later in this section,but some further explanation of the results is first required.\n\nThe largest discrepancies occur in the fusion zone predictions at high laser line energies.The simulations under-estimate the fusion width and, to a lesser extent, depth for the uppermost four data points in Fig.7 (a) and 7 (b).These data points correspond to the four highest values of power/sqrt(speed),which were Experiments 5,6,10 and 11 in Table 1. Previous comparisons of LPBF track simulations with experiment, for both Ti-6Al-4V [50,51] and steels [52-54],have also all under-predicted the track dimensionsat high laser energies.We believe that this trend is related to the onset of a transition to keyhole mode.Such a transition can be seen in both the measured track aspect ratios (refer discussion concerning Fig.3) and in the melt pool simulation results described shortly. An association with keyhole development is also consistent with the observation that fusion zone dimensions are under-predicted but HAZ dimensions are not.",

    "content": "It is now well-established, particularly by the group at LLNL [1,15], that the laser flux during LPBF is primarily incident on the melt for all regimes other than at very low energy densities.Fig.1O illustrates this observation by plotting the laser flux,as a percentage of maximum, for the same three cases as in Fig. 9.At $6 0 \\mathrm { W }$ ,the heating extends over the whole melt pool and there is also a small amount ahead of the melt pool, on solid material.At $1 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { W }$ ，themelt pool is larger and less than 2 percent of the heating occurs ahead of the melt.At 3oo W,laser heating is applied solely to the melt surface,and concentrated on the leading face of the melt depression.The spots of heating on the rear face stem from reflections off the front face.\n\nThe LLNL group also found that the effective laser absorptivities of plates with and without a powder layer become similar once melting begins [25,55].With all other conditions the same,the steady melt pool behaviour in a powder layer closely resembles that of a bare plate,and the fusion zone dimensions of solidified tracks are also similar [31].To illustrate this point, we modelled a case with a layer of $5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ diameter spheres spread in a regular array acrossa plate (Fig.11).There are differences in detail,of course.The melt surface lies somewhat deeper in a powder bed which tends to promote multiple laser reflections, increasing the total heat transfer to the metal and therefore the melt volume.Also,variabilityabout the steady state averageis increased bya powder.However,the fundamental heat transfer mechanisms are the same so that laser absorptivity values determined from bare plate experiments are equallyapplicable to powder beds.\n\n![](images/cf9cc6183523e03d77c2aa544143d28e10dab167fb9c0579fce51e07777f09aa.jpg)  \nFig.8Copaofuaedssipladhtthte",

One route to an optimum absorptivity fit would be to runa large number of additional simulations and adjust absorptivity by ever-smaller amounts to minimise this error. However,a much more efficient method is possible because the dimensions are proportional to laser power,especially in the conduction mode regime,and therefore to absorptivity aswell (refer Fig.2).This means that modifying absorptivity by a factor‘f'which is close to 1 changes each simulated dimension D (fusion or HAZ) by the same factor. Therefore,to calibrate absorptivity we simply find the value of f (call it $\\mathbf { f } _ { \\mathrm { m i n } } )$ which minimises the fitting error:\n\n$$\nE r r o r = \\sum _ { i } { ( f D _ { S i } - D _ { E i } ) } ^ { 2 }\n$$\n\nHere $\\mathrm { D } _ { \\mathrm { S i } }$ is a dimension simulated with an absorptivity of 0.32 in Experiment $\\mathbf { \\vec { i } } ^ { \\prime }$ ，and $\\mathrm { D _ { E i } }$ is the corresponding experimental dimension.

Random errors, which arise here chiefly from experimental sources such as fluctuations in the dimensions along each track,are responsible for the deviations in Figs.7 and 8 from the ideal 1:1 match.These random errors,which create the range in the values reported in Table 3 and the corresponding uncertainty in their averages,could be reduced by measuring more tracks and more cross-sections along each track.By contrast,errors in the laser power calibration and the high-temperature material properties used in the simulations (refer Section 3.4) create systematic shifts in all the fitted absorptivity values.The absorptivity error arising from a given material property depends on both the degree of uncertainty and the sensitivity of the simulated fusion and HAZ dimensions to that property.Sensitivity analyses of the properties listed in Table 2 established that thermal conductivity and specific heat are the predominant error sources due to their relatively large uncertainties and thermal diffusivity being a key determinant of melt pool dimensions.The estimated uncertainty in each property at high temperatures is up to $5 \\%$ [22].To gauge the resultant error,simulations were run with a $5 \\ \\%$ change in thermal conductivity or specific heat,applied across all temperatures to be conservative.These produced $3 \\%$ changes in average fusion and HAZ dimensions for each property,and therefore in absorptivity as well.In summary,the main sources of error are $3 \\%$ from laser energy, $3 \\%$ from specific heat, $3 \\%$ from thermal conductivity and $+ / - 0 . 0 2$ from experimental precision.As these errors are independent, theyare combined in quadrature and our measured value of Ti-6Al-4V absorptivity in conduction mode is $0 . 2 7 + / \\mathrm { - } \\ 0 . 0 3$\n\nTable 3 Absorptivity values fitted to various subsets of experimental data.

Our absorptivity measurement in the conduction mode regime represents the intrinsic material property of the Ti-6Al-4V melt surface.The higher value obtained when all experiments were considered suggests that the model is missing some physical mechanism which increases heat transfer to the substrate when the keyhole forms.First,though,we discuss the conduction mode results.\n\nThe melt absorptivity value of $0 . 2 7 + / \\cdot 0 . 0 3$ we find during LPBF in normal operating conditions is consistent with Ti-6Al-4V data published for other melt processes (Table 4).In an investigation of laser milling with a $1 . 0 7 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ Yb:YAG laser, Zamani et al.

This value is not referenced but their prior work [58] describes how to measure absorptivity by matching simulation results to weld geometry.

    "content": "The apparent increase in effective absorptivity which we observe at higher laser powers is a commonly observed phenomenon in LPBF. Virtually all melt pool CFD simulations which include validation against experimental track dimensions report discrepancies very reminiscent of those found in the current work, namely that the fusion width and depth are under-predicted when the energy density is increased. Such underprediction is seen for a range of build materials (Ti-6Al-4V [50,51], steels [52-54],Mo [54],Ni alloy [59]) with the maximum error ranging from about 20 to $5 0 ~ \\%$ 、All these studies employed a constant absorptivity which produced a good match of the simulated dimensions with experiment at lower laser powers.Omission of multiple laser reflections from some of these simulations contributed to under-prediction but it still occurred even when reflected rays were included,like in the current work.\n\nThere are two characteristics of the data at high laser power that need to be reconciled.The most obvious is that the fusion zone width is underestimated,and to a lesser extent the depth.The other is that the HAZ dimensions remain well-predicted.This finding about the HAZ is significant as,to the authors'knowledge,no previous simulations of LPBF have investigated this aspect. (Karayagiz etal.[49] did compare simulated HAZ dimensions to experiment but only in conduction mode with a single combination of laser power and speed.) The HAZ finding adds an important constraint on explanations for the high-power behaviour.We now explore a variety of possible causes,including those put forward in the literature.",

    "content": "The assumption of a constant intrinsic absorptivity,as applied in the current simulations,must first be examined.For example,a melt absorptivity that increased with temperature might improve the calibration.However,such a temperature dependence appears unlikely since laboratory emissivity data for molten Ti6Al4V[2O] and Ti [6O] display, if anything,a slight tendency towards the opposite trend.Perhaps the increasing fraction of laser power incident on molten rather than solid surfaces might somehow be responsible.This explanation can also be discounted as the fraction is already close to 1.O (refer Fig.1O) and,in any case,melt absorptivity is markedly lower than the solid absorptivity so that a larger fraction would reduce the laser heating.\n\nAnother possibility is that the laser beam width increases at high power for some reason.We tested this idea with a sensitivity test based on Experiment 6,which at 30o W and $6 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ exemplifies the keyhole regime.The simulated fusion zone width and depth were l68 and 180 $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,respectively,both under-predicting the experimental values of 247 and $2 0 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ as we have noted.When the analysis was repeated with the beam width increased by $1 0 ~ \\%$ (at constant total power),the simulated width increased to $1 8 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ but the depth decreases, to $1 6 3 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .From this and other tests,we found that broadening the beam to better match the experimental width enlarges the contact area of the melt pool with the underlying substrate so that the depth drops,and faster than the width increases.The overall agreement is not improved so it is concluded that the calibration mismatch is not simply due to error in the beam width.",

    "content": "The remaining explanation for under-prediction in the keyhole regime is that energy transfer from the laser beam to the substrate is enhanced by some mechanism which is missing from current LPBF models.It appears more complex than just invoking an effective absorptivity greater than the intrinsic material value.We simulated that case with a sensitivity test based on Experiment 6; increasing the absorptivity by $2 0 \\%$ increased the fusion width and depth by $1 3 \\%$ and 26 $\\%$ ,respectively.Although these movements are in the desired direction, we require the width to increase faster than depth for an improved experimental match.Furthermore,the associated increases in HAZ width anddepth ( $1 6 ~ \\%$ and $2 4 ~ \\%$ respectively) move both dimensions away from the experimental results.In general terms,we conclude that improving the model agreement with keyhole mode results requires slightly more heat deposition and,more importantly,a partial redistribution from the beam centre out toward larger radii.

    "content": "The vapour produced by melt evaporation has several influences to consider.First,it exerts a drag force on the melt surface.In laser welding,this can broaden the keyhole by pushing the liquid outward around the keyhole rim [61,62] and thereby increase the fusion zone width.It is an open question whether vapour drag can similarly broaden the melt pool in LPBF,but it seems likely.We know that vapour release creates a recoil pressure which can depress the melt surface.(For example, removing the recoil pressure term from the simulation of Experiment 6 reduces the fusion zone depth from 180 to $8 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .) The vapour jet is also sufficiently powerful to entrain powder particles adjacent to the track and then eject them,along with spattered melt droplets [63,64].Second, the vapour plume can attenuate the incident laser beam.This is wellestablished in welding and also seen in LPBF where fine metal particles in the vapour, smaller than $1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ ,reduce laser intensity by Rayleigh scattering [65-67].For Ti6Al4V in LPBF conditions,Ye etal. [25] found a $1 0 \\%$ reduction in effective absorptivity was necessary to match experimental data and ascribed it to this scattering mechanism.In keyhole welding applications,the plume often broadens the heating profile as well [66].However,this is largely due to inverse Bremsstrahlung heating [57] which is absent for the shorter laser wavelengths used in LPBF [67,68].For LPBF,it is even conceivable that a vapour concentration in the keyhole could trap radiation and narrow the heating profile,if that extra heat is efficiently transferred to the keyhole wall.",

    "content": "Next,we turn our attention to the influence of the keyhole surface geometry on laser heating. The keyhole geometry is highly unstable because of the complex interplay between laser heating,multiple reflections,shadowing,vapour emission with associated recoil, Marangoni stirring and other factors.The considerable literature on this behaviour forkeyhole laserwelding,reviewed recently [62],is largelyapplicable to LPBF as well.A detailed description is not attempted here but we note some key observations from recent X-ray imaging of LPBF [69,70]. Because the melt surface is removed faster than beam velocity [71],a periodic series of'humps’run down the front of the keyhole surface, sized up toa few tens of $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ 、Avariety of other surface oscillations are seen,some generated by the collapse of vapour pockets created by reflection concentrations on the rear keyhole wall. The fluctuations of keyhole shape increase with laser energy and create pinched-off voids that impact part quality as unwanted porosity.All these geometric perturbations increase the overall energy transfer by producing more laser reflections than would arise from a simple concavity.The Fresnel behaviour,i.e. that the intrinsic absorptivity passes through a peak at high angles of incidence,augments the overall absorption still further [13].Surface instabilities generated by melt evaporation on an even smaller scale,similar to or less than the laser wavelength,can enhance laser absorption by trapping reflections.This is usually regarded as an increase in intrinsic absorptivity. Such ‘micro-roughness’is thought to occur from surface ripples generated by vapour drag,predicted theoretically by Golubev[72],or from the related Rayleigh-Taylor instability of a gas moving over a denser fluid.The latter phenomenon was invoked by Schneider et al.",

Vapour recoil and vapour shearadd to the fluid forces,with rapid smallscale surface fluctuations creating further complication.Even advanced simulations cannot accurately capture all this behaviour at present. Since convective heat transfer is thought to dominate conduction in the keyhole (Peclet numbers of order 10 are observed there [73]),any error in the simulated flow could affect the predicted fusion dimensions.Some sensitivity tests based on the Experiment 6 simulation were therefore conducted.To gauge the effect of the overall velocity magnitudes,melt viscosity was increased by a factor of 2.Although the melt kinetic energy decreased by about $3 0 \\ \\%$ ，the fusion width and depth changed (decreased) by only $1 \\%$ and $5 \\%$ ,respectively,and the HAZ even less.To determine the sensitivity to the degree of lateral circulation,the Marangoni driving force was increased by $5 0 ~ \\%$ .The melt kinetic energy increased by about $1 0 ~ \\%$ ,but the fusion and HAZ dimension changes were less than $2 \\%$",

This work establishes robust correlations among processparameters,melt pool and keyhole morphology,and materials properties.These findings provide valuable insights into thecomplex interplay among diffrent design factors in metal 3Dprinting,laying astrong foundation forthe developmentof highly effective and efficient additive manufacturing processes.\n\nKeywords Thermal-fluid model $\\cdot$ Discrete element method $\\cdot$ Finite element method $\\cdot$ Multiphysics $\\cdot$ Phase transformation $\\cdot$ Solidification $\\cdot$ High-speed X-ray imaging",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, has emerged as a groundbreaking technique, offering unparalleled capabilities to fabricate intricate parts with fine structures.This transformative technology,however, includes many material and process parameters that exhibit complex interdependencies [1-4]. This inherent complexity poses significant challenges to fully understanding the transient behavior of the melt pool and keyhole dynamics,as well as the energy coupling mechanisms that occur between the high-power laser and the material. However, understanding these mechanisms is of paramount importance.Instabilities in the melt pool and keyhole (or vapor depression) can result in a multitude of structural irregularities that compromise the structural integrity and performance of the built parts [5-7]. Porosity, for instance, can be a direct consequence of these instabilities [8],along with phenomena like the balling effect [9], spattering [1O],and the emergence of anomalous microstructural phases [11]. These defects not only influence the mechanical properties of the printed components but can also pose a barrier to their implementation in critical applications,where the use of additive manufacturing parts for fracture-critical purposes remains a consideration. Therefore,a comprehensive understanding of the underlying phenomena governing the melt pool and keyhole dynamics is necessary for process optimization,real-time monitoring and control, and porosity mitigations.",

    "content": "Among the various AM techniques,Laser Beam Powder Bed Fusion (LB-PBF) in particular is recognized for its adeptness in 3D printing metals, particularly Ti-6Al-4V, enabling the production of parts with intricate features, optimized geometries,and reduced weight [12-16]. Nevertheless,the LB-PBF processing of Ti-6Al-4V necessitates in-depth exploration of the fusion and melt pool dynamics to comprehensively understand the material-laser interactions.This understanding encompasses a wide range of multiphysical phenomena,including heat and mass transfer, phase transitions,and solidification. Given the challenges tied to experimentally characterizing these interconnected processes,the development of multiphysics models stands out as an effective approach to disclose the key parameters governing the process and defects throughout the AM process.Numerical simulations for Ti-6Al-4V within metal AM play a pivotal role in optimizing process parameters and ensuring the quality and performance of manufactured parts.",

These studies provide insights into phenomena such as melt pool dynamics, keyhole instability,and potential manufacturing defects including pore formation, surface roughness,lack of fusion between build layers,spatter, and balling.Martin et al.[13] conducted simulations focusing on the keyhole pores located at the end of the welding track to provide a strategy aimed at minimizing the occurrence of these pores. In another work,Lin et al. [3O] employed simulations to reveal that adjusting the incident angle of the laser beam could effectively reduce the prevalence of keyhole pores in laser welding processes. Bayat et al. [27] investigated the correlation between input power and the formation of keyhole pores and evaluated their simulation findings using experimental results.Wang et al. [26] studied the mechanisms of keyhole pore formation during AM process and examined the lifetime dynamics of keyhole pore generation mechanisms and their corresponding keyhole melting regimes under different conditions. Khairallah et al. [23] investigated the interdependent meso-nanosecond dynamics and defect generation in metal 3D printing using a combination of in situ diagnostics and simulations.Their study revealed that controlling the laser scanning conditions can circumvent spatter and reduce defect generation,and that the thermionic emission is correlated to laser scanning conditions that give rise to pore formation and regions where surface defects are pronounced.",

The accuracy of the simulations depends strongly on the material parameters set in the models;specifically,material absorptance is defined as the ratio of absorbed versus incident radiant flux at a specific location during the AM process [33]. Notably, there have been very few investigations focused on simulating the absorptance of material, specifically for Ti-6Al-4V, primarily due to the complex interplay of various physics involved in the process [26, 32].

    "content": "While it is true that this titanium alloy has been extensively researched in the context of AM and LB-PBF, the focus of this study on Ti-6Al-4V was driven by the persistent challenges that limit its manufacturing efficiency and material properties. Furthermore, the majority of existing literature primarily emphasizes the development of models to examine these mechanisms and trends, often lacking rigorous experimental validation.This paper aims to enhance our understanding of process parameter effects on the melt pool and keyhole dynamics,material absorptance,and pore formation during LB-PBF of Ti-6Al-4V by using fully coupled multiphysics meso-scale simulations and ultrahighspeed synchrotron X-ray imaging.The approach used here is to(1) develop and calibrate a high-fidelity multiphysics model to simulate the LB-PBF process and the dynamics of different features including melt pool and keyhole,(2) evaluate quantitatively and qualitatively the simulation predictions against experimental results including in situ X-ray images and absorptance measurements,and(3) disclose interconnections and correlations among melt pool and keyhole dynamics,material absorption,and pore formation.",

The parameters, including laser power, scanning speed,and spot size,were chosen to be similar to those of the laser available for experiments performed at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab to ensure consistency and relevance in our simulations. Additionally,experimentally, these selections mimic typical build conditions and give a melt pool that can be measured.This comprehensive approach allowed for the exploration of an expansive parametric space.These simulations were performed to validate the models against experimental measurements and data,as well as to examine the interplay of these varied process parameters (e.g., laser power, scanning speed, and spot size). The latter specifically focused on the interactions between melt pool and keyhole geometries, as well as characteristics including absorption,and pore formation.",

    "content": "An interesting observation can be made when we compare the melt pool depths and widths between bare substrates and substrates covered with powder beds, both subjected to the same laser power, as shown in Fig.2(b, c, d, f).We note that both the melt pool depth and width for bare substrates exceed those of substrates with powder beds.This implies that the presence of a powder bed, even at a relatively modest thickness of $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ,imposes a notable influence on (or delay into the bulk) the laser penetration dynamics. This leads to a reduction in both melt pool depth and width when compared to the scenarios involving bare substrates.This phenomenon can be linked to the inherent properties of the powder layer. The powder bed acts as a barrier that absorbs and disperses some of the incoming laser energy before it reaches the solid substrate beneath. Thus, the heat generation and subsequent melt pool formation are delayed and somewhat suppressed in the presence of the powder layer. This effect underscores the importance of considering powder bed characteristics when optimizing laser-based AM processes. Similar behavior can be seen for keyhole length and width shown in Fig. 3(b,c, d, f).",

    "content": "Figure 3 provides a comprehensive comparison of the keyhole length and width between simulation results and the corresponding experimental data for different cases. It is noted that, in these measurements,we used the upper surface of the solid substrate as the reference line for keyhole length and width analyses.In instances where both the continuous bulk and fragmented break-up regions (bubbles) coexist within the same frame (as shown in Fig. 4),we quantified the keyhole length by solely accounting for the continuous, connected portion while disregarding the separated break-up part. The relative L2 errors for keyhole length are 0.3928, 0.3601,and 0.5888 for Fig. 3(a, c, e),respectively. The relative L2 errors for keyhole width are O.352O, 0.2795, and O.359O for Fig. 3(b,d, f),respectively. In contrast to the relatively stable behavior of melt pool depth,keyhole lengths show significant temporal fluctuations in these cases. These significant temporal fluctuations in keyhole lengths are attributed to the dynamic nature of keyholes during the laser-powder interaction process.As the laser beam interacts with the material and/or powder bed,different factors come into play, such as the ejection of vapor and the interaction of the laser energy with the surrounding environment, that lead to variations in keyhole length over time [24,51]. Similarly,although to a lesser extent,fluctuations are observed in keyhole widths. These fluctuations,while smaller in range compared to keyhole length, can be attributed to variations in the deposition of materials and the local thermal conditions within the keyhole.In sum, the dynamic nature of keyholes,coupled with the intricate interplay of laser energy, material properties,and powder bed configurations, results in the temporal fluctuations observed in both keyhole length and width,as shown in the simulations and confirmed by experimental measurements.\n\n![](images/484d56eb8912a758e54b64754865b69dc49bb7fd67aa9c63a59ce28a8803fd1a.jpg)",

    "content": "The continuous increase in melt pool depth and keyhole length over time can be atributed to the complex dynamics involved. The continuous energy deposition into the material results in localized melting and subsequent expansion of the melt pool.As the laser continues to deposit over the same area,more energy accumulates,leading to a deeper and wider melt pool until the laser is turned off. The same behavior is seen for the keyhole during the process.The keyhole can lengthen as more laser energy is supplied for the stationary case in which metal evaporation is enough for deep keyhole formation.As the keyhole extends, it can sometimes become unstable,leading to breakage or collapse. When a keyhole breaks, it can leave behind voids or pores in the material. They are a direct consequence of the intricate and dynamic thermal and fluid interactions within the melt pool and keyhole regions during the AM process.",

It allows us to understand how effciently the laser energy is absorbed by the material during the laser-powder interaction process.

    "content": "Figure 9(a) plots the melt pool aspect ratio,which is calculated as a melt pool depth over the projected crosssectional width.For both classes of cases,a small upward trend in the aspect ratio can be observed. However, it is noteworthy that the powder layer cases typically exhibit a more linear increase in aspect ratio when compared to the somewhat variable behavior observed in the bare substrate cases.This trend in the melt pool aspect ratio is a significant indicator of the evolving melt pool shape as NEI varies.The differences between bare substrate and powder layer cases suggest that the presence of the powder layer has a more consistent and predictable effect on the aspect ratio as energy input changes, possibly due to its role in energy absorption and dissipation within the laser interaction zone.This is also consistent with previous study that found the powder smooths out a lot of absorptance dynamics [37].A similar trend can be seen for keyhole aspect ratio in Fig. 9(c). In this case, both the bare substrate and substrate with a powder bed show a linear increase in aspect ratio,and these trends are described by linear fits with high $R ^ { 2 }$ values. Additionally, both lines overlap very closely, indicating that they follow the same keyhole aspect ratio function. It is worth noting that at higher NEI values, there is a notable increase in variance (or standard deviation) compared to lower NEI values. This higher variance at elevated NEI levels suggests that as the energy input becomes more substantial, the system response becomes less predictable,potentially due to the interplay of multiple dynamic factors at play.",

For the melt pool width in Fig. 9(b),we observe that the width for bare substrate (solid) is generally higher than that of the solid with a powder bed. The differences in width are likely attributed to the unique energy absorption and dissipation dynamics associated with each substrate type.For the keyhole width shown in Fig. 9(d),we observe a similar behavior compared to the melt pool width plot.In this case,both the bare substrate and substrate with a powder bed show comparable behavior.Both sets of data exhibit linear fits with high $R ^ { 2 }$ values, indicating a strong correlation between normalized keyhole width and NEI. The positive slope of these linear fits signifies that as NEI increases,the normalized keyhole width also increases.While the presence of the powder bed affects the melt pool width, it does not significantly alter the correlation between NEI and keyhole width. This consistency in the keyhole width response suggests that NEI plays a predominant role in shaping keyhole dimensions, irrespective of the substrate type.",

    "content": "Lastly,Fig. 9(e) shows keyhole angle as a function of NEI for both scenarios, namely, bare solid and solid with powder bed cases. As NEI increases, keyhole angle tends to approach a steady-state value that is near 9O degrees.This behavior aligns with the understanding that in stationary laser setups, there is no defined “front’or directional bias,which leads to keyhole angles that gravitate toward perpendicularity to the substrate. In essence,as the energy input intensifies, the keyhole angle stabilizes at a nearly right angle to the substrate surface.Crucially,both the bare solid and powder layer cases exhibit a very similar keyhole angle function with respect to normalized energy input.This indicates that the keyhole angle responds in a consistent and predictable manner as NEI varies,regardless of whether a powder layer is present. Additionally, it is noteworthy that there is a relatively high variance (standard deviation) in keyhole angles at lower NEI values when compared to higher NEI values.This variance reflects the sensitivity of keyhole angles to changes in energy input, with lower NEI levels leading to greater variability in the keyhole angle response.However,as NEI increases and approaches higher values, the keyhole angles become more stabilized and approach a near 9O-degree orientation.\n\nWe found that the keyhole aspect ratio exhibits scaling with only one dimensionless parameter, i.e., the Keyhole number Ke [54] (also known as normalized enthalpy [55]),\n\n$$\n\\mathrm { K e } = { \\frac { \\eta P } { \\left( T _ { \\mathrm { l } } - T _ { 0 } \\right) \\pi \\rho C _ { \\mathrm { p } } { \\sqrt { \\alpha V _ { \\mathrm { s } } r _ { 0 } ^ { 3 } } } } } ,\n$$",

In the first plot (a),there is a linear relationship between the keyhole number and surface energy density,with both the bare solid and powder layer displaying substantial overlap.The second plot (b) elucidates a linear correlation between the keyhole number and the melt pool aspect ratio,where the bare solid tends to exhibit higher values than the powder layer. Interestingly, both appear to saturate the melt pool aspect ratio around 10 when the keyhole number exceeds 25. This saturation suggests that certain constraints or equilibrium conditions are reached as the keyhole number increases.As the keyhole number increases,it affects the energy distribution within the material and the dynamics of material flow within the melt pool. This influence of the keyhole on the melt pool becomes more pronounced as the keyhole number rises. Once a critical keyhole number is reached, the interaction between keyhole formation and melt pool behavior stabilizes,leading to a consistent melt pool aspect ratio.

This pore formation arises from an inherent instability in the elongated shape of the keyhole,a characteristic often observed during laser-based AM processes (see supplementary videos). Deep keyholes, with their extended and slender profiles,are prone to instability.As the laser beam interacts with material and forms the keyhole,these deep keyholes frequently undergo a sudden collapse during the AM process.

This is a welldocumented phenomenon in the AM literature,explored in several studies that investigate the physics of keyholeinduced pores [7, 22, 23,25-27]. These studies delved into the complex interplay of forces acting upon the keyhole, including surface tension, recoil pressure,and Marangoni force. They also examined the roles of buoyancy, gravity, and thermocapillary forces in governing the motion of bubbles throughout the AM process.A critical factor contributing to keyhole-induced pore formation is the depth of the keyhole.When the keyhole reaches a depth where the laser rays no longer reach its bottom, the temperature within this unexposed region experiences a significant drop.This localized temperature decrease induces an increase in surface tension forces while concurrently reducing the recoil pressure at the base of the keyhole.For a more in-depth understanding and comprehensive analysis of the underlying mechanisms driving pore formation, interested readers can refer to references [22, 23].",

    "content": "Furthermore, the number of pores is notably lower in bare substrate when compared to the substrate with a powder bed. This difference can be attributed to a combination of factors, including keyhole dynamics and the availability of nucleation sites,both of which are influenced by the presence of the moderately thick powder bed.In scenarios where a power bed is present, the dynamics are more complex.The powder bed not only offers additional material for bubble formation but also provides numerous nucleation sites.The vaporized particles can serve as nucleation sites where gas bubbles initiate and grow.\n\nMoreover,an interesting phenomenon is observed when varying the beam diameter while keeping the laser power constant. Specifically,as the spot size increases,the size of individual pores tends to decrease.This trend can be attributed to the dynamics of heat distribution and energy concentration within the larger spot size.In scenarios with a larger spot size,the laser energy is dispersed over a broader area,which results in a more uniform distribution of heat. Consequently, the localized regions within the melt pool may not reach the threshold temperature required for the formation of larger gas bubbles.Instead,smaller bubbles form due to the more evenly distributed energy. Hence,an increase in spot size typically corresponds to a decrease in the size of individual pores within the resolidified metal.",

    "content": "While it is well established thatthe microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4Vallys are sensitive to their thermal history，a relatively small portion of the processing space has been explored.Additive manufacturing methods such as Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF)ofer extreme flexibility in processng conditions,but are still primarily limited through Edisonian experiments.This implies that thereare new processing domains that could yield Ti-6Al-4V with favorable mechanical properties or improved build productivity. Using efficient X-ray Computed Tomography methods to quickly screen the density and subscale tension tests to identify mechanical properties of L-PBF Ti-6Al-4V,we leveraged Gausian Process Regresion (GPR) machine learning models and Bayesian Optimization sampling strategies to eficiently explore the L-PBF processing space to discover new processing domains.This study revealed (1) a substantially larger procesing window to produce dense material (porosity $< 0 . 1 ~ \\%$ by varying power,speed,and hatch spacing,(2) anability to tune processing conditions to achieve yield strengths ranging from 980 to 1o95 MPa and elongation from $4 . 6 \\%$ to $1 3 . 5 \\%$ (3)a unique high density processing regime associated with high laser power,high laser velocity,and small hatch spacing,which was previously avoided due toconcernof baling instabilities in single line trace experiments,and (4) new processing domains with improved mechanical properties and deposition rates. The new processing conditions resulted in extreme microstructural variation with differences in grain morphology,size,and texture. The degree of texture and grain refinement exhibited in the reconstructed $\\beta$ grains of some samples partially explained the large amount of ductility and variations in strength in the tested samples,although more sophisticated microstructural representations are required to fully explain the observed behavior.",

    "content": "Titanium alloys such as Ti-6Al-4V are extremely appealing for additive manufacturing (AM) of aerospace components due to the alloy's unique properties such as low density and high strength [1],as well as AM's potential to bypass challenges with Ti-6Al-4V's poor machineability,and improve the“buy-to-fly\"ratio-the ratio of the raw material prior to fabrication compared to the weight of the machined part [2]. However,the mechanical behavior of Ti-6Al-4Vis notoriously sensitive to changes in the material's thermal history during processing,as has been widely reported in many studies using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) to process Ti-6Al-4V [3].To mitigate L-PBF processing challenges such as microstructural embrittlement, cracking,and porosity [3], there is clearly a need to eficiently optimize the alloy's processing conditions to achieve desired tradeoffs between high strength,ductility and deposition rate.In this work,we propose the use of Bayesian optimization (BO) [4] that leverages Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate models to efficiently identify new L-PBF processing conditions with favorable tradeoffs between strength,ductility and processing speed. Coupled with high-throughput porosity and mechanical testing capabilities, this approach is shown to enable a much larger processing window than previously identified,including specific conditions with diverse microstructures and extremely variable mechanical properties.",

    "content": "The mechanical properties of L-PBF Ti-6Al-4V are intricately related to its microstructure and defect content,which in turn depend on the material's processing history.The low ductility of L-PBF samples is generally attributed to porosity [5] and the presence of the $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ martensite phase [6].Higher ductility and strength can be achieved by the formation of low aspect ratio $\\alpha$ -grains around Lack of Fusion (LOF) defects after a HIP treatment of built parts [7].A ductile mechanical response has also been shown in samples that have $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ or $\\mathfrak { a } + \\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ microstructures [8, 9].It has been suggested that twinning at the $\\alpha / \\beta$ interface could be a contributor to plasticity during mechanical deformation [1O].The role of strain induced twinning in the plastic deformation of the alloy was verified with later work [2] as well as the importance of the initial texture orientation or the twinning systems.This ductile mechanical response was controlled by an intrinsic heat treatment during the build to promote the decomposition of the $\\alpha ^ { \\prime }$ into the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ phases.The spatial distribution and crystallographic orientation of the grains is therefore critical in the performance of L-PBF Ti-6Al-4V parts.Intrinsic heat treatment performed during the build was shown to increase the ductility of the parts [2].Samples intentionally built with keyhole (KH) defects showed larger strengths than those samples that had equivalent amounts of LOF defects [11].",

    "content": "Given the complexity of Ti-6Al-4V's processing-structure-defectproperty relationships,it is clear that the mechanical properties of AM parts are likely to vary substantially across the processing window. Historically,processing recipes for Ti-6Al-4V and otheralloys have been performed through heuristic approaches,such as linear parameter sweeps or heuristically-designed studies [l2,l3]．However，this approach is inefficient and ultimately impractical due to the multi-physics processes that govern the mechanical properties of L-PBF Ti-6Al-4V [14]. To overcome this,a combination of BO approaches to efficientlysamplethelargeprocessingdomain—aswellas high-throughput testing techniques to efciently generate more experimental data-are proposed as a pathway to navigate the potentially complex mapping between processing conditions,generated defects, and mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V.\n\nBO methods leverage machine learning surrogate models such as GPR models to learn the response of a function across a design domain, and then use the predicted response of the surrogate model to intelligently sample the design domain to maximize a certain objective [4]. This makes BO approaches well suited to efficiently study design spaces with nonlinear responses with fewer experiments,especially in cases where human intuition or prior knowledge may be inadequate to guide the experiments.For instance,GPR models can effectively model the nonlinear relationships between L-PBF processing conditions and porosity [15],as demonstrated by Liu et al.who leveraged GPR models to identify an unexpectedly large processing window for $\\mathbf { A l S i _ { 1 0 } M g }$ with high relative density [16].In other application spaces,GPR-based BO has been used to design mechanically tough lattice structures [17],and to accelerate the discovery of new materials [18].Notably, however,BO has not been adopted within the additive manufacturing community to learn process-defect-property linkages [19].",

    "content": "In the same vein, newer high-throughput methods as developed by [13,20] can obtain large quantities of data to guide process optimization studies,which can overcome cost constraints associated with performing large numbers of conventional experimental measurements.However,it has proven too costly to simultaneously quantify the porosity and quasistatic mechanical properties of large quantities of samples.For instance,Liu et al.screened the density of 99 samples,but only the tensile properties of a subset of them [l6].Agrawal characterized the density and hardness of 425 316 L stainless steel samples,though the hardness provided only indirect predictions of the actual mechanical behavior [2O].To the author's knowledge,no study has experimentally explored the density and mechanical properties acrossa three-dimensional parameter space consisting of laser power，scan speed,and hatch spacing for L-PBF Ti-6Al-4V. Such a multi-modal dataset would permit the discovery of new processing domains that are optimized for good mechanical properties,density and/or deposition rates.\n\nThis work aims to efficiently discover processing conditions using BO search schemes that lead to extreme variation in microstructure and mechanical properties.Refined methods of collecting high-throughput X-ray computed tomography (XCT) and sub-scale mechanical testing reduce the material needed for testing and the amount of time needed to run the tests.These high throughput methods also provide ML models with the necessary data to identify the new L-PBF build regimes with accelerated deposition rates and favorable mechanical properties.",

XCT can more efficiently quantify porosity in AM material than metallographic methods,particularly when large volumes of material must be analyzed to detect extreme,fatigue-critical defectsas revealed byarecent cost analysis [21].This method was leveraged here to quickly screen large quantities of small-volume specimens to define the dense process window.These measurements were used to generate data to train the GPR model,as discussed later in Section 2.6.\n\nSamples were scanned using a North Star Imaging X-5O microfocus XCT at $1 2 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ voxel size resolution with scan times of less than three minutes per sample,compared to scan times of at least $2 0 \\ \\mathrm { m i n }$ per sample as reported in the literature [21],although typically used to inspect larger volumes and with imaging less noise.To achieve rapid scan times,we co-designed the sample geometry and scan procedure to maintain a high resolution of $1 2 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ voxel size,low scan noise and achieve fast scan times.This was achieved by designing a small but representative sample size of $6 \\mathrm { m m }$ diameter and $6 \\mathrm { m m }$ height,as well as using geometric magnification and $\\mathbf { 2 x }$ image binning.The final sample size still permitted sampling of approximately 60 laser tracks per layer over 2oo layers.Internal validation studies have shown that this sampling volume is sufficiently representative of larger samples.

In addition,the size and shape of the parent $\\beta$ grains varied tremendously from sample to sample as shown in the reconstructed EBSD maps.EBSD was therefore also used to determine the maximum ferret diameters of all the grains in the reconstructed parent grains as shown for all of the samples in Fig.8(e).The average of the maximum ferret diameters varies between samples with the lowest having a value $4 8 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (A01)and the highest having a value of $2 1 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (B35) in the XZ plane.The variation in the maximum ferret diameters in the XY plane is less significant with values ranging from $3 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $6 1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .Thereisa large variation in the grain size within each sample as well.This is in part due to some of the grains being so large that they do not fall entirely within the confines of the EBSD map but also because the number of grains within each map is different, e.g.,215 for A01 and only7 for B35 in the XZ plane (excluding hexagonal grains).",
