In this study we performed an extensive parameter development investigation to better understand the effect of laser parameters on surface roughness, density, and porosity of SLM Inconel 718 parts. Laser energy density was varied via laser focus shift, and the effects on porosity in both as-printed and post-HIP treated states were analyzed. Tensile testing was also conducted to investigate the effect of processing conditions on the mechanical properties of SLM 718. It was found that for these laser parameters, while the material met ultimate tensile strength and yield strength requirements per AMS 5662, the strain-to-failure was reduced with negative focus shift due to increases in porosity levels. It was also found that while correlations were observed between surface roughness, density, and porosity within the laser focus shift range investigated, porosity measurement appears to be the clearest indicator of build quality for AM processed 718.",

    "content": "The development of various additive manufacturing (AM) technologies is being pursued for numerous industries and applications, such as medical devices, orthopedics, thermal control, aeronautical, space launch, and spaceflight [1–5]. AM processing enables the ability to produce complex geometries, reduce component counts, improve economics of small production runs, and dramatically reduce lead times in production environments [1,3,6,7]. In particular, the laser powder-bed fusion method known as selective laser melting (SLM) is under widespread development due to its capability for improved quality and freedom in designing and manufacturing complex geometries [1,6–11].",

    "content": "Published research has shown that SLM material attributes such as surface roughness and internal porosity are driven primarily by laser scanning strategy and shielding gas flow, and can be minimized by controlling the energy density via laser parameter tuning [10,12–18]. Energy density is a function of laser power, scan speed, and scan spacing and is responsible for porosity levels in as-printed parts, and can be described by Eqs (1)–(3) in Section 3. Designs of experiments typically adjust these three parameters to understand their influence on porosity. Lower scan speeds and smaller scan spacing providing higher energy density, which is usually associated with lower porosity [10,12,14,19]. Laser parameters can also influence surface roughness, but reduced side wall surface roughness requires lower energy density input to reduce melt pool size and surface tension variation within the melt pool [20]. Laser settings can thus be optimized to yield faster build rates, lower porosity, or better surface finish, depending on the requirements of the application. Additional influence of equipment on porosity and surface finish have been controlled through scan strategies [14] and process gas flow [19]. Ultimately, processing conditions that reduce the scale and amount of porosity will benefit both static and dynamic mechanical properties [10,11,21,22].",

    "content": "Furthermore, it is anticipated that most alloys processed by SLM for aerospace and other high-strength, high reliability applications will also require the use of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) to reduce porosity. The amount and type of as-built porosity and its relationship to process parameters is critical and must also be considered when manufacturing AM metallic hardware. Developing an understanding of what size and degree of porosity can be consolidated during HIP is highly beneficial to process engineers when optimizing print conditions in order to produce high-quality parts. Pores that cannot be closed by HIP, whether because they are connected to the surface or are too large to close effectively, would likely be detrimental to the mechanical behavior of selective laser melting-produced Inconel 718 (SLM 718).\n\nOne alternate method to improve surface roughness and possibly reduce porosity when printing with a locked OEM parameter set is by changing the energy density via the laser focal height shift, which can be adjusted just as laser power, scan speed or scan spacing. To adequately melt the powder and form parts of acceptable quality the energy density and spot size of the laser are important. An appropriately tuned laser must have a spot size small enough to meet dimensional tolerances, but also supply enough energy density to melt the current powder layer and fuse to the previously melted metal, in the case of the M2 this is a three-layer depth. Energy density can be altered by modifying variables within the machine’s laser parameter set [10,13–15], but if only a locked set is available, the energy density can be effectively varied by modifying the laser focus shift.\n\n![](images/c3b2e2b89c4cee6d2936247ec8dbe571e90035db40ea27f714eac497a1964fd8.jpg)  \nFig. 1.

Inverted pyramid sample geometry, showing labels built into sample, sectioning plane for metallographic analysis.\n\nLaser focus shift describes the distance that the build plate is moved above or below the user-calibrated zero-plane of the system before the current layer is printed. Positive shifts move the build plate below the zero-plane (increased distance from laser) while negative shifts move the build plate above zero as shown in Fig. 1. While this is a different approach compared with directly changing the three main scan parameters previously discussed, changes in focus shift will vary the effective laser energy density by changing the spot size. Adjusting the focus shift has not been discussed in the same manner as modifying other parameters, but in related work, the focal offset of the beam in electron beam melting has been found to influence similar properties in Ti-6Al\n\n4 V [12].\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine the effect of laser focus shift on the surface quality, density, and porosity of specimens produced using SLM processing and understanding how these characteristics affect mechanical performance. To study these effects, a build plate and witness sample geometry was designed so that an array of samples were built at varying lateral positions throughout the build plate and with varying laser focus shifts. These specimens were characterized to determine surface roughness, porosity, and density values before and after HIP treatment. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength and failure strain were also evaluated as a function of laser focus shift to determine which material characteristics are the best indicators in predicting build quality.",

    "content": "Surface roughness is controlled by a number of factors such as laser calibration, laser power, scanning parameters, and gas flow. Since all of the laser settings were held constant during the build, we believe the uneven variation in surface roughness across the build plate is due to an unstable flow of the protective gas across the build plate. A schematic representation of gas flow path in the build chamber can be seen in Fig. 6. Although positive laser focus shifts in the $^ { + 3 }$ to $+ 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ range resulted in a reduction in average surface roughness for vertical and angled faces, the roughness variation across the build plate (Fig. 5) indicates that adjusting the laser focus may lead to turbulent gas flow. It has been shown that inhomogeneous protective gas flow, such as is produced in turbulent flow conditions, can lead to increased surface roughness due to insufficient removal of process byproducts and interaction of the laser with these byproducts [8,9]. These focus shifts correspond to the build plate being shifted downward $3 { - } 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ below the plane of the build chamber which changes the gas flow path considerably and introduces the possibility of turbulent flow, analogous to gas flow over a blind hole where areas near the edges would not experience the same type of environment as those in adjacent areas. The smoothest measured surface was sample $+ 3 \\mathrm { D }$ $( \\mathrm { R a } = 5 . 1 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ , however the focus shift that produced the overall smoothest samples at all positions was $+ ~ 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ (average $\\mathrm { R a } = 2 1 . 3 \\mu \\mathrm { m } $ .\n\n![](images/67671c186cb468dfc7fc275e48550b25e94ca394c2eb7866004b5b82cd1f70d0.jpg)  \nFig. 5.

    "content": "Density measurements were performed on all samples printed at focus shifts of $+ 3 , \\ + 4$ , and $+ 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ , in the as-printed condition. Density measurements exhibit a non-linear variation across the build plate and an inverse relationship with surface roughness (Figs. 7 and 8). This suggests that a similar mechanism may be responsible for both surface roughness and density variations, and may be related to the coupling of laser focus and protective gas flow.\n\nThe images in Fig. 9 illustrate the large variation observed in porosity levels with respect to the focus shift level. It should be noted that the large gaps observed on the top surface of the samples are due to the numerical labels printed into the surface, not porosity. Porosity levels were significantly higher for negative laser focus shifts, with the highest porosity measured in the sample printed at $- 2 \\mathrm { - m m }$ focus shift $( 7 . 1 \\% )$ and lowest porosity levels observed in the $+ 5 \\mathrm { - m m }$ shift sample $( 0 . 8 1 \\% )$ .

    "content": "Laser energy density is highest at the laser focal point and attenuates with laser focus shift. By overlaying the results of porosity analysis with a relative power density curve and correlating with the types of porosity observed, the symmetry of these results can be used to infer a laser focal point near the $+ 3 \\mathrm { - m m }$ build shift position (Fig. 11). At low focus shift values, such as the specimen printed at $- 2 \\mathrm { - m m }$ focus shift, large, connected porosity and un-melted powder particles within the internal cavities are produced during the printing process (Fig. 12a). This level of irregularly-shaped porosity, taken with small amounts of un-melted powder within the pores indicates a lack of fusion due to insufficient laser energy at the melt pool. As the build plate is brought closer to the laser focal plane, increased power density improves consolidation, and the morphology of porosity changes to smaller, more dispersed gas bubble porosity, as observed in specimen printed at $^ { + 1 }$ - mm focus shift (Fig. 12b). As the focus shift continues to increase, the power density increases further, and excessive energy at the melt pool causes keyhole porosity as shown in Fig. 12c for the specimen printed at $+ 3 \\mathrm { - m m }$ focus shift. Increasing the focus shift to $+ 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ again reduces laser power density to levels more ideal for consolidation (Fig. 12d).\n\n![](images/a2a4857c57d453dc74ac5297818ac436a6524a7e770eb5d3296528d6393f8dd1.jpg)  \nFig. 10. - Variation in laser spot size and power density, calculated with respect to build focus shift.\n\n![](images/b7aa120b8da2d5605c94368b67d393f4fbb030c2db1486b331a32ae56504f42a.jpg)  \nFig. 11.

Samples were processed with a standard Inconel $7 1 8 ~ \\mathrm { H I P }$ cycle as described in the experimental section.

Density measurements of HIP treated specimens show an average increase of $0 . 2 6 \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ , which corresponds with reductions in porosity between $2 3 \\%$ for the $+ 4 \\mathrm { - m m }$ specimen and $8 5 \\%$ for the $+ 5 \\mathrm { - m m }$ specimen, as illustrated in Fig. 13.

    "content": "Along with laser settings, shielding gas flow uniformity has been shown to have the largest impact on process stability and material quality in SLM parts [8,9,13]. Shielding gas flow serves to remove process by-products produced during the melting process, which include ejected powder, spatter, metal vapor, condensate, and the plasma plume. Low gas flow leads to re-deposition of by-products onto the build surface as well as interaction of the laser beam with the byproducts, resulting in attenuation of the laser beam and degradation of surface and bulk material quality. Examining the differences between specimen $+ 4 \\mathrm { B }$ and $+ 4 \\mathrm { E }$ shown in Fig. 5 displays this effect. We believe the visibly increased surface roughness of sample $+ 4 \\mathrm { E }$ is due to ejected powder and spatter not being effectively removed by gas flow and consequently becoming fused to the part surfaces. Positioning of the build plate far from the base level of the build chamber increases the likelihood of uneven flow across the build plate, especially without sufficient flow velocity. When the laser beam is attenuated by the welding plume, less energy reaches the powder surface and penetrates the powder, which can lead to the formation of larger spherical particles of molten metal rather than fusion with the powder bed, a phenomenon known as balling [9]. This condition is seen in Fig. 12a. Additionally, if gas flow is not sufficient to carry ejected powder and metal vapor away from the melt pool, the re-deposited material will produce a thicker layer nearby, which will be melted on following laser passes. Even without attenuation of the laser beam, it may not be possible to fuse this additional material to the powder bed below. This will similarly lead to formation of larger spherical particles on the surface.",

    "content": " This balling phenomenon is also commonly seen in lower laser power regimes [8,9,15], which explains why it is observed at regions of the build plate which have lower laser energy (below $+ 2 { \\cdot } \\mathrm { m m }$ focus shift) as well as in regions with uneven gas flow.\n\n![](images/6a9e651d0ae7ddca34b3c7a1b3a60e40dce270271b726023060e81296cf8f83e.jpg)  \nFig. 14.

However, based on this system’s specified maximum flow rate volumetric flow rate is on the order of $4 5 \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } / h$ when blower speed is set to $7 0 \\%$ . Gas flow path has a large influence over the flow rate and uniformity over the build plate. Fig. 6 shows an illustration of the gas path in the M2, but without detailed modeling of the build chamber and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, it is difficult to quantify the flow over the build plate. However, it has been found that increasing gas flow rate and improving the gas flow path through modification of inlet and/or chamber geometry improves material quality and decreases variation in surface roughness and porosity [8,9,11,14].",

    "content": "Finally, to better understand the effect of laser focus shift on mechanical properties, rods were printed at $+ 3 , 0$ , and $- 3 \\mathbf { m m }$ laser focus shift. These specimens were heat treated and machined into round tensile specimens and tested at room temperature as described in the experimental section. Tensile samples were taken from four positions on the build plate: top-left (TL), middle-left (ML), top-right (TR), and middle-right (MR), as illustrated in Fig. 3. Visual inspection of the rods in the as-printed condition showed rougher surfaces on the right side of the build plate and increasing roughness with lower laser focus shifts. This is in line with the trends observed from the witness pyramids. Even though surfaces were machined away before testing, this may still provide a first indication of internal material quality.\n\nTensile testing revealed position and focus shift dependence of mechanical properties. All specimen met yield and ultimate tensile strength requirements, per AMS 5662, exceeding them by $1 4 \\%$ and $6 . 5 \\%$ , respectively, for the lowest strength specimen, as reported in Table 1. However, elongation and reduction in area requirements were not met by a number of specimen. The only samples that met both requirements were printed on the left-hand side of the build plate at 0- mm and $+ 3 \\mathrm { - m m }$ focus shift, and the sample printed in the MR position at $+ 3 \\mathrm { - m m }$ focus shift.",

    "content": "To gain a better understanding of these mechanical property variations, cross sections of tested specimen were mounted to evaluate the degree of porosity as well as variations in morphology between samples. Samples printed on the left-hand side have lower porosity than corresponding samples on the right-hand side, at all focus shifts. At porosity levels below $^ { 1 \\% }$ , porosity is typically small, circular, and disconnected, which is indicative of gas bubble porosity. At the highest levels (samples printed at $- 3 \\mathrm { - m m }$ focus shift) there are large, connected voids with unconsolidated powder visible. This is consistent with porosity observed in the inverted pyramids printed at negative focus shifts, which also showed high porosity levels. The low density and higher porosity measurements correlate well with the lower observed elongation and reduction in area values. This indicates while all samples met yield and ultimate strength requirements after heat treatment, elevated porosity levels are responsible for reduced elongation. Therefore, low elongation at room temperature may be considered a reliable indicator of gross defects within SLM 718 specimens.",

    "content": "An array of specimens were built at varying laser focus shift heights to determine the effects of laser focus shift and position on the build plate on material quality. Material density, porosity, surface roughness, and room-temperature tensile properties were characterized. All room temperature tensile test specimens met yield and ultimate strength requirements and appeared to be insensitive to higher porosity levels. However, the higher-porosity samples did not meet elongation and area reduction requirements. This indicates that room temperature ductility of tensile specimens may be more perceptive of material quality issues than strength for SLM 718. This may be a result of Inconel 718 being a precipitation-strengthened alloy which benefits from the standard heat treatment regardless of porosity level.\n\nVariations in the amount and degree of porosity with respect to focus shift can be related to the power density distribution due to attenuation of the Gaussian laser optics. For the output laser power used in this study, the ideal power density for consolidation is at roughly one Rayleigh distance, which suggests that in order for higher-density samples to be built at the focal plane, laser parameter should be adjusted to melt powder with roughly one-half of the power density. Additionally, the porosity type and amount determines whether pores can be closed via HIP treatment. Large connected porosity and unconsolidated powder cannot be corrected, but small discreet gas porosity is effectively closed by HIP treatment. As such, it may not be necessary to perform an exhaustive optimization with the aim of minimizing gas porosity for samples and parts that will be processed via HIP treatment before testing or use.",

    "content": "Protective gas flow within the build chamber may be responsible for lateral position-dependent variations in surface roughness. It was observed that roughness did not increase monotonically across the build plate for vertical surfaces, but instead there was a W-shaped trend with maximum roughness measurements for left, middle, and right positions (positions $^ { \\mathfrak { a } } \\mathbf { A } ^ { \\mathfrak { n } }$ , “C”, and $^ { \\mathrm { t } } \\mathrm { E } ^ { \\mathrm { \\prime \\prime } } \\big ]$ ). Additionally, specimens built far from the laser focal plane exhibited surface roughness that exceeded the measurable threshold the profilometer due to the sintering of particles to printed surfaces at much lower energy input coupled with insufficient removal of process by-products by the protective gas. Modification of the gas flow rate and/or path would improve uniformity of surfaces across build plate. A direct correlation was seen between surface roughness and porosity, and an inverse correlation with density. These findings indicate that density and surface roughness may be used as first-order quality control evaluation methods for determining SLM 718 build soundness.",

    "content": "Printer settings such as laser power and focal height interact with system gas flow within the build chamber to influence resulting material quality. A large focus shift may be necessary to reach the desired location with respect to laser optics, but simultaneously may create detrimental gas flow conditions, introducing turbulent flow or no-flow areas. Likewise, the optimal focus shift position is dictated by laser parameters such as output power and scanning speed. Therefore, these results are a first step towards optimization of not only laser parameters but machine setup, and illustrate that even prior to performing an indepth laser parameter development study the user can have a large amount of control over both internal porosity and surface quality by modifying laser spot size via laser focus shift. By tuning the laser focus shift and evaluating its effects on print quality, the relative improvements in average density of our SLM 718 samples was $1 . 5 \\%$ , surface roughness was decreased by $2 8 \\%$ , and porosity was reduced by $9 7 \\%$ .\n\nTable 1 Physical properties of tested sub-size tensile samples.

To make functional parts with high form accuracy and superior surface integrity, an as-SLM part needs finishing to remove the deposited surface material. The integration of machining and SLM creates a hybrid manufacturing route to overcome the inherited limitations of SLM. However, little study has been done to characterise surface integrity of an as-SLM part followed by machining (e.g. hybrid SLM-milling). In this paper, surface, integrity including surface roughness, microstructure, and microhardness, have been characterised for IN718 samples processed by the hybrid process. It has been found that microhardness varies with the scan direction and the use of coolant in the subsequent milling, and surface integrity can be significantly improved by the hybrid SLM-milling route.\n\nARTICLE HISTORY Received 26 September 2017 Accepted 8 October 2017\n\n# KEYWORDS\nSurface integrity; selective laser melting; machining; hybrid manufacturing",

    "content": "The widely used additive manufacturing (AM) process to manufacture metal parts is selective laser melting (SLM), which consists of the use of a laser to melt metallic powders in a layer-by-layer fashion. While SLM allows new freedoms and possibilities in terms of design, there exist several limitations due to the process nature. Most of these limitations arise from the high thermal gradient in the melt pool, which leads to poor dimensional accuracy, high surface roughness, high porosity (Gu et al. 2012), and tensile residual stresses (Kruth et al. 2012, Li et al. 2016).\n\nThe improvement of surface integrity of SLM part can be manifested in two ways: process optimisation and post-processing of an SLMed part. Gu et al. (2012) summarised studies with focus on optimising process parameters such as laser power, laser speed, powder layer thickness, substrate temperature, powder bed temperature, and scanning strategy. Additionally, the effects of post-processing techniques such as heat treatment have been studied for several metallic powders and processes (Li et al. 2017a). Rolling process was used during AM to obtain smaller grain size and superior mechanical properties (Xie et al. 2016). Recently, laser shock peening has been used in SLM to control the residual stress profile of the final part (Sealy et al. 2016, Kalentics et al. 2017). The use of machining as post-processing to improve surface finish has been applied in directed energy deposition process for decades (Jeng and Lin 2001). Limited research has been focused on the surface integrity of part by hybrid SLM-machining.",

    "content": "# 3.1. Microstructure and defects\nFigure 2(a) shows the YZ cross-section of dry machined sample 4. This image shows the laser passes travelling horizontally across the page. These passes were distinctly separate from each other, with most boundaries being dictated by laser passes, rather than by the naturally occurring grains in the microstructure. Some small porosities can also be seen here, with sizes ranging from 10 to $5 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ . Figure 2(b) shows the XZ cross-section of sample 5. This can be seen by the series of overlapping semi-circular patterns which are formed due to the solidification of melt pool from each laser pass. Figure 2(b) shows a uniform distribution of laser passes, with clear overlaps and limited voids. Another notable cause of voids in the part is the balling effect. The balling effect is the tendency of a molten liquid to become a sphere due to the surface tension of the liquid. An example of the balling effect is shown in Figure 2(c). Scan speed and laser power are the two significant factors that contribute to balling. Balling effect can be limited by process parameter optimisation. Figure 2(d) shows an example of the balling effect in a void with a length of almost $8 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . While multiple factors likely lead to its formation, the size in many ways was added by the formation of the balls. When analysing the depth of this void, it can be seen to retreat slightly over $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ into the surface. A void in this size would greatly affect the fatigue life of a part, and could be a safety concern depending on the part’s loading and importance.",

    "content": "The roughness of the as-SLM samples was too large to be measured using the Dektak IIA measuring system. Three findings were made. The first is in comparing the resulting $R _ { \\mathfrak { a } }$ vales with flood and dry milling. On average, dry milling resulted in lower $R _ { \\mathfrak { a } }$ values by $0 . 1 1 3 \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ , or $2 3 . 6 \\%$ . This suggests that dry machining would typically create a better surface finish in SLM parts. Next the average measurements in the scan and step-over directions were compared. The $R _ { \\mathfrak { a } }$ values were found to be lower by $0 . 0 8 \\mu \\mathsf { m } _ { i }$ , or $1 6 . 8 \\%$ , when measured in the step-over direction. The last comparison involved investigating any possible interactions between the cutting and scan directions. This analysis found that lower $R _ { \\mathfrak { a } }$ values occurred when the cutting direction and scan direction aligned, with a percent difference in this case of $6 . 8 \\%$ . It should be noted that the average standard deviation is $0 . 1 1 \\ \\mu \\mathsf { m }$ , which reduces the significance of these findings. This high variability is most likely due to the irregular positioning of the porosities.",

    "content": "The $R _ { \\mathfrak { a } }$ values after milling for SLM samples were compared against conventionally fabricated IN718. The following data were measured from samples that had been machined with coolant under the same cutting conditions (Li et al. 2014): $R _ { \\mathfrak { a } }$ values measured in cutting and perpendicular to cutting direction is 0.15 and $0 . 1 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , respectively. It shows that the SLMed samples with cutting direction both perpendicular and parallel to the scan direction have higher $R _ { \\mathfrak { a } }$ values. These values signify a percent increase of $2 6 0 \\%$ and $2 4 7 \\%$ in comparison to the conventionally manufactured parts. Comparing the $R _ { \\mathfrak { a } }$ values measured perpendicular to the cutting direction shows similar results. The SLM sample which had a cutting direction perpendicular to the scan direction has an $R _ { \\mathfrak { a } }$ value that is $0 . 4 1 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ greater than that of the conventional sample, and the SLM sample which had a cutting direction parallel to the scan direction has an $R _ { \\mathfrak { a } }$ value that is $0 . 1 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ greater than that of the conventional sample. These changes represent increases of $2 5 6 \\%$ and $7 5 \\%$ , respectively. High $R _ { \\mathfrak { a } }$ values in the SLMed samples are due to the porosity in the parts. On average, the SLM samples have $R _ { \\mathfrak { a } }$ values that are $2 1 9 \\%$ greater than those of the conventionally manufactured samples.",

    "content": "The porosity discussed above contributes greatly to the overall variation of hardness of the samples. As part of this study, the changes in hardness values at depth due to the machining passes were investigated. Chatterjee et al. (2003) found the hardness of an SLMed tool steel to be a direct result of the part porosity, and it can be assumed that the porosity of other materials plays a large role in their hardness. This assumption can be validated through hardness tests. Figure 4(a–c) shows optical images of hardness indentation tests. All hardness tests were conducted using a load of $2 5 0 { \\mathfrak { g } }$ and duration of $1 5 s .$ .\n\n![](images/1496a6c93404fdd4245744551d028779c2da45af8252f0d81ca2591a34da5bb3.jpg)  \n(a) Surface topography of sample 1 prior to milling; (b) after milling; (c) surface roughness $R _ { \\mathfrak { a } }$ values of the machined samples.",

    "content": "As shown in Figure 4(a), a slight increase in indentation size was observed because of proximity to a void, proving the relationship between hardness and porosity. A decrease in Vickers Hardness of $1 0 8 . 8 5 \\ \\mathsf { H V }$ for the top indent pair and a decrease of $1 1 8 . 2 0 \\ \\mathsf { H V }$ for the bottom indent pair. There exist several possible reasons for this change. The first is the proximity to the porosity, as the ability of the material to support itself could be compromised by the void. The second is the tendency of material to ‘fold over’ voids during indentation tests. This third possibility is due to the $\\gamma ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ phase, which largely contributes to the hardness in IN718. It is possible that imperfect melting and solidification of the IN718 particles could cause changes in the properties of the microstructure. Throughout the course of the hardness testing, other low hardness zones were also found. The largest zone is shown in Figure 4(b). In this example, the center-left indentation is notably larger than any others in its vicinity, especially those at the same depth. The difference in hardness measurement between this indent and its counterpart $8 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to its right is $2 8 0 \\ \\mathsf { H V } ,$ , representing a decrease from 423 to 143 HV. While hardness values can be theoretically improved at the surface through machining, the influence of porosity and voids cannot be negated. The final area which showed fluctuations in hardness is in the area close to the substrate. In all samples tested, the lowest hardness values (excluding the outlier shown in Figure 4(b)) were always found at the part–substrate interface. On average, the indentations along the substrate line were $1 4 . 3 \\%$ lower than those throughout the rest of the sample, representing a decrease on average from about 396 HV to $3 3 9 \\ \\mathsf { H V } .$ As shown in Figure 4(c), a rippling effect can be seen around each indentation.",

Accurate readings began at around $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } _ { i }$ ; however, there was difficulty in analysing the hardness in the shallow depth region. It is evident that any changes in hardness due to the machining process are hidden in this area.

    "content": "# 4. Summary and conclusions\nIn this study, surface roughness and microstructure before and after machining of SLMed IN718 were characterised. The use of milling was found to result in a smoother surface on average. Other possible interactions between milling, scan, and measurement direction were identified; however, the high variability of the results shows the need for repeat testing, and improvement of process parameters. The microstructure analysis showed porosities, voids, and low hardness zones in the subsurface. The high porosity resulted from imperfect process parameters. By fabricating an SLM part with near-full density, a more accurate analysis of the effects of milling on a part would be possible.\n\nThe porosity and microstructure also affected the hardness profile significantly. The most significant finding was the low hardness along the part–substrate interface. The next step will be to analyse the microstructure of this interface more closely to identify any possible phases’ change that may be causing the change in hardness. Also, after optimising the process parameters to create a part of near-full density and then using a nano-indenter to focus on the subsurface zone less than $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , the hardness profile would be much more likely to provide insight into the exact effects of machining. This work is a prelim study on the surface integrity of hybrid SLM-milling process. A further study is planned to investigate more SLM and milling parameters.\n\n# Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.",

Collection of such data enables the study of the variability of melt pool geometry (e.g. width, depth, and cross-sectional area) across process space. Furthermore, the statistical distribution of the measured melt pool geometries is compared to that of an equivalent normal distribution and intriguing outliers are observed. The cross-sectional morphology of the melt pools are associated with defects such as keyholing porosity and balling and the variability of the defects is quantified. The final product of this work is a robust description of L-PBF In718 melt pool behavior, based on ex-situ observations, which can be linked to in-situ observations of melt pool morphology in future work.",

    "content": "In their endeavors to exploit the design freedoms that come with Additive Manufacturing (AM), designers must push the boundaries of the machine processing parameters. It therefore becomes necessary for them to understand how those parameters impact the final part quality and what kinds of defects and degree of melt pool dimensional and morphological variability they can expect. Currently, AM machine manufacturers offer only a limited set of “approved” processing parameters for each material system, limiting the design freedom of the end user. Beuth and Klingbeil [1] were among the first to study the effects of processing parameters on melt pool geometry in the AM space. Since then, such effects have been studied extensively by many researchers. For example, Promoppatum et al. [2] investigated the influence of laser beam power and velocity on melt pool size and microstructure in the Ti6Al-4V alloy system using both experiments and heat transfer simulations. Similarly, Francis [3] demonstrated the effects of laser beam diameter across multiple steel alloys. Tang et al. [4] discussed the fundamental relationships between laser beam power, travel velocity, and a processing defect known as lack-of-fusion porosity. Despite this large body of extant work, the variability of the melt pool behavior is often left unexplored, often due to the relatively small number of measurements collected. As observed by Clymer [5], such variability could have significant consequences for process parameter design and optimization in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, meaningful interpretation of data from in-situ process monitoring schema often requires correlation with data from ex-situ analyses and this linkage requires a truly representative sampling of melt pool behavior.",

    "content": "This work studies melt pool behavior across Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) process space for the Inconel 718 $\\mathrm { ( I n 7 1 8 ) }$ ) alloy (Ni $5 0 { - } 5 5 \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ , $\\mathrm { C r ~ } 1 7 . 0 { - } 2 1 . 0 \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ , Nb $4 . 7 5 { - } 5 . 5 \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ , Mo $2 . 8 \\mathrm { - } 3 . 3 \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ , Ti $0 . 6 5 \\mathrm { - } 1 . 1 5 \\mathrm { w t \\% }$ [6]. In718 is of significant interest to the AM community owing to a variety of desirable material properties including high temperature performance and excellent corrosion resistance. Indeed, Zhang et al. [7] have explicitly studied high temperature performance in the case of additively-manufactured $\\mathrm { I n 7 1 8 }$ while Mannan et al. [8] described and collated significant information relating to the corrosion resistance of several nickel super-alloys. As a result, In718 has multiple applications in the aerospace [9] and energy sectors [8]. Unfortunately, as explored by Thakur et al. [10], In718 remains difficult to machine via traditional, subtractive manufacturing processes. In contrast to subtractive manufacturing, additively-produced parts are built layer-wise. During L-PBF AM in particular, a laser beam is used to selectively melt a thin layer of metal powder in the shape of a crosssection of the desired final part. After each layer is fused, the build platform is lowered and a new layer of powder is deposited. The entire, layer-wise, process is typically referred to as a “build” and occurs within a build chamber purged with an inert gas.\n\nMany of the most important melt pool-scale defects in metal AM can be identified by the ex-situ morphology of the melt tracks themselves.",

    "content": "In this work, morphologies of interest are those characteristic of process outcomes including porosity formed by the keyholing mechanism, under-melting, and the surface tension-related balling phenomenon. Cunningham et al. [11] provide a comprehensive overview of porosity formation, due to a variety of mechanisms, in Laser and Electron Beam PBF AM. Keyhole and under-melting porosity are further explored by Gong et al. [12] for the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Gratzke et al. [13] provide an excellent theoretical basis for understanding balling during welding processes while Yadroitsev et al. [14] studied this phenomenon in LPBF specifically. Keyhole-mode melting occurs in the high energy density (high beam power, low beam velocity) region of process space, where significant vaporization of the molten material can occur. Under certain conditions, the resultant vapor pocket may become trapped as porosity in the solidified melt pool [12]. Under-melting occurs when the melt pool does not fully penetrate the powder layer [12]. Francis [3] has found that balling primarily occurs in the higher beam velocity and beam power regime of process space [3]. Specifically, as the melt pools lengthen relative to their widths, Rayleigh instabilities driven by surface tension forces cause the tail of the melt pool to first form “humps” and eventually cease to be a continuous melt track, instead breaking up into discrete “balls” as discussed by Yadroitsev et al. [14].",

    "content": "Importantly, these characteristic morphologies are known to occur with varying degrees of periodicity within a single melt track and the statistical behavior of these deviations are a central focus of this work. Such periodicity has been observed ex-situ in L-PBF by Olakanmi et al. [15] for an aluminum alloy. Recently, Zhao et al. [16] has observed much of this behavior in-situ via high speed X-ray imaging. Similarly, the geometry of the melt pool is generally accepted to vary along the length of a melt track, even when process parameters and local build geometry remain constant. Francis [3] and Wei et al. [17] have characterized the variable behavior of melt pool depth in keyhole-mode melting for L-PBF and GTAW welding respectively, and extensive research exists within the welding community on variability due to humping, as summarized by Wei [18]. Nonetheless, the existing literature is relatively sparse with regards to the statistical study of general melt pool variability in the AM processes. For this reason, this work constructs a statistically significant database of melt pool geometry and morphology for the $\\mathrm { I n 7 1 8 }$ material system. In addition to providing insights into such variability, the presented results are also used by the authors in concurrent work to facilitate the training of a Machine Learning algorithm for in-situ flaw detection [19].",

    "content": "One method for correlating process parameters with process outcomes (e.g. melt pool geometry, porosity, and as-built microstructure) is known as “process mapping.” Developed by Beuth and Klingbeil [1], this technique is used in this work to summarize the effects of laser beam power and travel velocity on the size of the melt pools as well as to delineate certain defect regimes. While process mapping of L-PBFprocessed In718 has been reported by Narra [20], those data are based on single cross-sections of each process parameter combination – precluding the study of morphological and dimensional variability. Furthermore, as found by Aboulkhair et al. [21] for balling and Montgomery [22] for melt pool depth, melt pool morphology can vary significantly depending the presence of a powder layer (vs. no powder). Therefore the use of the no-added powder experiments performed by [20] would be inappropriate for the purposes of linking in-situ and exsitu observations during construction of a bulk part, which is the goal of the authors’ concurrent work [19].",

    "content": "The experiment was performed on an EOS M290 (EOS GmbH, Germany) L-PBF machine at Carnegie Mellon University’s (CMU) NextManufacturing Center and consisted of 10 melt tracks at each of 36 different process parameter combinations. The tested beam powers range between $1 0 0 \\mathrm { W }$ and $3 7 0 W$ (the maximum power of the EOS M290 machine) and the beam travel velocities range between $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } /$ s and $1 4 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ – spanning the majority of the EOS M290’s operating range. These parameter combinations are subsequently indicated in Fig. 7 and were chosen based on the Rosenthal analytical heat transfer model of a moving point heat source [23]. The Rosenthal model by no means fully describes the physics driving melt pool formation as it assumes steady-state conditions and a point heat source [3] as well as neglecting temperature-dependent material properties, the latent heat of fusion, and all non-conduction heat transfer mechanisms including fluid flow within the melt pool itself. However, when fit to experimental data1 it is sufficient to inform experiment design decisions. Specifically, the Rosenthal results were combined with the work of [20] and the balling threshold presented by Francis [3] to ensure that the test region of process space would include multiple instances of keyholing and balling anomalies. Additionally, the Rosenthal results allowed for the estimation of a maximum expected melt pool width $( 3 5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ and length $( 8 6 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ , thus enabling the determination of a conservative hatch spacing $( 5 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ and melt track length $\\mathsf { 2 0 } \\mathrm { m m }$ .

Each melt track is $2 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ long to ensure steady-state2 melt pool conditions in the crosssectioned regions. The melt tracks were exposed on top of a single layer of powder as opposed to a bare substrate and were spaced sufficiently far apart $( 5 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ to avoid any overlap between adjacent melt pools. Due to the importance of a consistent powder layer for these experiments, denudation of the region around the melt track is also an important consideration. Work by Matthews et al. [24] finds that the denudation zone extends between $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and $2 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ from the center of the melt track for processing conditions similar to those explored in this work. Therefore the denudation zones of adjacent melt tracks are not expected to have influenced the observed melt pool morphologies. To mitigate the effects of residual heating due to adjacent melt tracks the exposure order of the melt tracks was adjusted such that a minimum of $_ { 1 . 6 s }$ elapsed between the lasing of adjacent melt tracks. For more information on residual heating due to laser scan strategy the authors refer the reader to the work of Parry et al. [25].",

    "content": "To maintain a consistent powder layer thickness for all of the melt tracks, the $\\mathrm { I n 7 1 8 }$ plate was first mounted to a modified steel EOS build plate and then surface ground. Because the In718 plate had to be removed from the modified steel EOS build plate before being placed inside of the EOS M290, their relative orientations during surface grinding were recorded. Note that layer-wise post-fusion consolidation, described by Jacob et al. [26], of the metal powder results in an effective powder layer thickness that is greater than the thickness of the layers within the AM part (i.e. the nominal layer thickness). To better match the nominal $4 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thick layers used in the authors’ concurrent work [19], a $7 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\pm 2 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thick powder layer was chosen. This choice was made assuming a consolidation factor $( 1 - \\rho _ { p o w d e r } / \\rho _ { f u s e d } )$ of $4 0 \\%$ [26]. Note that the true consolidation percentage is dependent upon the particle size distribution of the specific powder system used; however such a measurement is beyond the scope of this work. The uncertainty in powder layer thickness was quantified by measuring the change in the separation distance between recoater blade and the build plate over the entire area of the $\\mathrm { I n 7 1 8 }$ build plate; relative gap measurements were performed using a Käfer dial depth gauge. Systematic error in the powder layer thickness is assumed to be minimal (less than $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ as a result of the procedure used to determine the gap between the recoater blade and the $\\mathrm { I n 7 1 8 }$ plate. During this procedure, after leveling of the plate with the profilometer was complete, the gap was systematically decreased in increments of $1 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ until the recoater blade was unable to travel across the $\\mathrm { I n 7 1 8 }$ plate.",

    "content": "Based on the cross-sectional micrographs, each parameter combination was categorized as producing one or more of five different types of melt pools: desirable, balling, severe keyholing, keyholing porosity, or under-melting using both qualitative and quantitative measures. Specifically, balling melt pools were defined as those exhibiting the characteristic balling morphology [14]. Processing parameters were considered to produce severely keyholed melt pools if the average depth to half-width ratio was greater than 2.5. Note that previous studies such as those by Francis [3] strictly define keyhole-mode melting as occurring for any aspect ratio greater than 1.0. As discussed by Elmer et al. [31], this is the largest aspect ratio which can be modeled under purely conduction-mode melting conditions. It should be noted that vapor cavities (and therefore non-conduction mode melting) are observed throughout AM processing space [32,33]. Because all of the tested process parameter combinations produced keyholing melt pools, the 2.5 threshold was used as a means of differentiating cross-sectional melt pool morphologies. If any of the melt pool cross-sections for a given parameter combination contained keyholing porosity, that process parameter combination was categorized as keyholing porosity. Process parameter combinations producing melt pools with average depths less than the powder layer thickness of $7 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ were considered to be under-melting. Note that building a bulk part with these parameters would not necessarily result in lack-of-fusion porosity as seen in work by Tang et al. [4] due to the aforementioned post-fusion consolidation of the powder layer. Finally, any melt pools not otherwise categorized are considered desirable.",

Fig. 3b and c show normal probability plots for both the EOS nominal process parameters and the process parameter combination which deviated the most from a normal distribution, respectively. In a normal probability plot the data are sorted as they would be in a cumulative distribution function and then they are plotted on a nonlinear vertical axis representing the normal order statistic medians. If the data are samples which “come from a population with a normal distribution” [34] then they will fall along a straight line [34]. Note also that in the implementation [34] used to generate the normal probability plots in this manuscript, the equivalent normal distribution is calculated using only data from the second and third data quartiles.",

    "content": "It is evident from Fig. 3 that the melt pools with cross-sectional areas deviating the most significantly from the equivalent normal distribution form a lower tail. That is, while most of the melt pools follow a normal distribution, in some samples several melt pools of a significantly smaller size are present. Similar outlier behavior is found for both cross-sectional width and depth. These deviations are quantified by calculating $R ^ { 2 }$ fit values between the data and its equivalent normal distribution (both of which have been linearized); insufficient data are available for a Chi-square test which would typically require 25–40 measurements [35]. The majority of the cross-sectional geometry measurements follow normal distributions with the outliers following the trend discussed above, suggesting that the use of confidence intervals based on Student’s t-distribution [35] in Section 3.3 is appropriate. Overall, out of the 36 process parameter combinations, six produced cross-sectional area distributions with $R ^ { 2 }$ values less than 0.80. For the same $R ^ { 2 }$ threshold, the cross-sectional width and depth distributions significantly deviated from a normal distribution for eight and nine process parameter combinations, respectively. Note that the negative $R ^ { 2 }$ values reported in Fig. 3 indicate that the model (i.e. a normal distribution) fits the data more poorly than a horizontal line.",

    "content": "The precise driver(s) for these outlier melt pools is unknown and warrants further study; however the literature suggests multiple, nonexclusive possibilities. Work by Ladewig et al. [36] indicates that the highly dynamic interaction between the vapor plume and the incident laser beam can significantly reduce the amount of beam power absorbed by the substrate. Such interference would reduce the size of the melt pool and would likely be highly stochastic and therefore difficult to predict. Similar interactions are observed by Bidare et al. [37], with an additional focus on the interactions between vapor flow and the powder bed such as powder particle entrainment, denudation, and spatter formation. Ly et al. [38] further investigate spatter generation as a mechanism for carrying energy away from the melt pool proper. Another possible explicatory mechanism is an interaction between the melt pool and solidified spatter particles deposited on the powder bed by previous melt tracks. This distortion of the nominal melt track is directly observed by Nassar et al. [39]. While deviations in the powder bed caused by dragged spatter particles [39] and spatter particles impacted by the recoater blade [40] have also been proposed as potential stochastic flaw-formation mechanisms, the single layer nature of the experiments presented in this work preclude this possibility. A review of the research surrounding spatter-induced defects is also provided by Grasso et al. [41]. With multiple mechanisms capable of distorting the topology of the powder surface as well as ejected powder particles affecting the energy absorbed by the melt pool, flow conditions and spatter ejection may be responsible for much of the observed stochastic variability. For these reasons, the authors consider this behavior to be further motivation for the development of methodologies for in-situ observation of the melt pool and surrounding vapor plume.",

    "content": "The magnitude of the variability of melt pool geometry across process space was also investigated. Fig. 4a shows the standard deviation (as a percentage of the mean melt pool dimension) for the crosssectional melt pool width. As discussed in the introduction and by researchers including Tang et al. [4], such variability must be carefully considered when designing optimal process parameters, as the occurrence of smaller-than-average melt pools could lead to insufficient overlap between adjacent melt tracks and lack-of-fusion porosity. Overall, the measured variabilities in melt pool width, depth, and area respectively range from approximately $2 . 9 \\% - 1 4 \\%$ , $4 . 5 \\% - 3 7 \\%$ , and $3 . 8 \\% { - 2 6 \\% }$ of the mean melt pool dimension. In all cases, the melt pool dimension variations are at least one order of magnitude larger than the measurement errors reported in Section 2.3. The variability of melt pool depth is notably higher for the melt pools produced using high beam powers and low beam velocities (Fig. 4b). Higher variability in this processing regime has been observed by Pastor et al. [42] in laser welding and by Francis [3] in L-PBF for multiple alloy systems. Zhao et al. [16] has found that, in this regime, drastic changes to the morphology of the vapor pocket can occur rapidly which can lead to sudden changes in the total absorption of the incident laser beam and the depth of the melt pool.",

    "content": "Application of the process mapping approach allowed for the generation of lines of constant melt pool geometries (Fig. 5). Specifically, 2D linear interpolation was used to generate a dense matrix of melt pool geometry values across beam power and beam travel velocity process space. This dense matrix was then queried such that a set of points in process space was produced at which the relevant melt pool geometry is the same. Linear functions were then fit to this set of points. The $R ^ { 2 }$ values between the linear fit functions and the melt pool geometry data were 0.92, 0.97, and 0.99 for cross-sectional width, depth, and area, respectively. Strictly, the reported $R ^ { 2 }$ values are calculated based the agreement between the model (e.g. linear fit) and the data from each sample with a measurement (e.g. melt pool width) within the range presented in the corresponding process map. For example, the reported $R ^ { 2 }$ values for the melt pool width are based on data from the samples with a measured melt pool width between $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and $2 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (see the legend of Fig. 5a). The melt pool size trends (e.g. higher beam powers and lower beam velocities produce larger melt pools) closely match those found in the existing process mapping literature. The focus of this work is on the dimensional and morphological variability observed for this material system, as discussed in the following sections.\n\n![](images/2607fffd3accdc8b5f4a44a89c7052340382f6e7009de206522fbb0e586ceb37.jpg)  \nFig. 4.

    "content": "# 3.4. Melt pool morphology classifications\nFig. 6 shows examples of the various cross-sectional morphologies while Fig. 7 summarizes the morphologies in processing space and is heavily utilized in the authors’ concurrent work [19]. It is worth noting that even the most extreme keyholing porosity and balling process parameter combinations do not always produce melt pool cross-sections that exhibit those defects. Indeed, for the parameter combinations characterized as balling, only between $5 \\%$ and $8 5 \\%$ of the cross-sections exhibited an obvious balling morphology. Similarly, for the parameter combinations characterized as producing keyholing porosity, only between $5 \\%$ and $5 5 \\%$ of the cross-sections contained keyholing porosity. This is not surprising as both of these flaw formation mechanisms are known in the literature to be periodic in nature (Section 1).\n\nIt is also worth noting that despite all of the tested process parameter combinations producing melt pools with depth to half-width ratios greater than 1.0, indicating keyhole-mode melting [31], keyholing porosity was only observed in melt pools produced by four of the thirty-six process parameter combinations. Indeed, keyholing porosity was not observed for beam velocities higher than $4 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / s$ , even for high aspect ratio melt pools. Prior welding research [42] and a growing body of AM research [16] indicates that regimes of stable keyhole-mode melt pools exist. In these regimes, the melt pool morphology is such that periodic collapse of the vapor pocket, and subsequent entrapment of the keyholing pore by the liquid front, is relatively infrequent. The authors refer the readers to the works of Zhao et al. [16] for videos of the process by which the vapor pocket “pinches off” at the base to generate a keyholing pore.",

Analysis of the distributions revealed that cross-sectional melt pool widths, depths, and areas primarily follow a normal distribution with the exception of a handful of outliers which clearly diverge from a normal distribution. Interestingly, the divergent melt pools almost exclusively formed lower tails (visible in Fig. 3a), that is, the divergent melt pools were significantly smaller than the majority of the melt pools produced by that process parameter combination. The authors propose that the behavior of these outliers be studied further, particularly to determine if it is due to an interaction between the laser beam and the vapor plume and if the behavior differs across material systems.",

    "content": "The large sample size also allowed for the quantification of the variability of the melt pool dimensions across process space. This information is critical for designers as they work at the edges of viable L-PBF processing space, particularly for the determination of the appropriate (to ensure overlap) spacing between adjacent melt tracks. As has been previously reported for welding by Pastor et al. [42] and PBF AM by Francis [3], melt pool depth variability was highest within the severe keyholing regime – where the morphology of the vapor cavity directly under the beam spot can vary abruptly. It is important to note that, even with the addition of a powder layer, the presented experiments represent a simplification of the environment found during L-PBF fabrication of bulk components. For example, closer spacing between the melt tracks will result in denudation of powder particles around the melt pool as well as more complex wetting behavior due to the presence of a solidified melt track on one side of the melt pool. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the machined surface finish of the substrate in this work is perfectly analogous to the topology of the AM-fabricated surfaces upon which subsequent layers are deposited. These factors can be reasonably expected to further increase the variability of the melt pool morphology; therefore the variability observed in this work should be considered as a minimum variability which may occur during part\n\n![](images/677950410ac45b385ccb7b78221b7bb8f767b197d79fa54209121bde0a9f5b7e.jpg)  \nFig. 6.

    "content": "fabrication.\n\nLinear curves of constant melt pool cross-sectional width, depth, and area are reported across L-PBF beam power and beam velocity process space. The presented curves of constant geometry are bounded by confidence intervals based on a total of 720 melt pool cross-sections. While correlations between process parameters and melt pool geometry have previously been reported for this material system by Narra [20], those cross-sectional results were based on single measurements of each process parameter combination and the experiments were performed on a bare substrate without a powder layer. The authors are currently studying the influence of the presence of a powder layer (compared to a bare substrate) on melt pool size and morphology for the $\\mathrm { I n 7 1 8 }$ material system.\n\nFinally, each process parameter combination was classified based on the morphology of its melt pool cross-sections. Interestingly, even though all of the process parameter combinations produced melt pools with depth to half-width ratios greater than unity (keyhole-mode melting), only a small subset of the combinations resulted in porosity trapped in the solidified melt pool. This behavior implies the existence of a stable keyholing regime, an occurrence which has been observed in the prior welding literature. Notably, even the most extreme keyholing porosity and balling process parameter combinations did not always produce melt pool cross-sections exhibiting those defects. These ex-situ classifications and defect frequencies are used extensively in the authors’ concurrent in-situ monitoring work [19]. The authors also observe that the occasional drastic departures of melt pool dimensions from a normal distribution further motivate the need for robust in-situ process monitoring methodologies to ensure part quality for critical applications.",

The poor surface quality, porosity and tensile residual stresses of the fabricated parts may limit the wider application of metal-based additive manufacturing (AM) techniques despite their vast potential. Therefore, post-processing of AM components is required to eliminate the superficial and volume defects.\n\nCurrently, the development of new post-processing technologies (thermal, mechanical, chemical treatments) is very attractive since they may improve the components fabricated by the AM methods. For instance, an implementation of post-processing techniques in the AM routes, such as special heat treatment, hot isostatic pressing or hot isostatic pressing combined with heat treatment [1–4], electrochemical polishing [5], media blasting or tumbling [6], ultrasonic excitation [7], and surface severe plastic deformation [8–13], could minimize or eliminate the defects (residual porosity and/or excessive roughness) in the metal components. The post-processing methods can be selected based on the application requirements, geometry complexity, size of parts and required surface quality. A combination of different methods can also be applied.",

    "content": "The AM methods using a laser beam are new alternative technologies for manufacturing components instead of conventional metal forming methods [14–16]. The SLM process is one of an advanced manufacturing method, which allows the production the complex three-dimensional (3D) parts directly from 3D computer models by selectively melting successive layers of metal powder on the top of the previous one using a scanning laser beam [17]. Compared to conventional manufacturing methods, the SLM process has important advantages relating to a reduction of the production steps and high material building efficiency, as well as the possibility for manufacturing thin-walled parts from materials difficult to machine [16]. In addition to that, the manufacturing costs are weakly dependent on the component complexity. Trosch et al. [18] have shown that the SLM process provided mechanical properties at least as good as conventional forged or cast materials. Manufacturing of the parts by the SLM process allows the highest geometrical flexibility and accuracy as compared to the other laser-based AM processes. Moreover, in comparison with the SLS process, the SLM process leads to significant improvement in the microstructural and mechanical properties owing to full melting of the metal powder material to form the solid 3D parts [14]. Another major benefit of the SLM process relates to its high feasibility in the processing of some pure non-ferrous metal materials including Ni, Ti, Al, and Co alloys [17,18]. Thus, the production of lightweight metal parts for the aerospace and automotive sector is considered to be feasible only using the SLM process.",

    "content": "However, it should be noted that the SLM process still has some disadvantages. In particular, the SLM-fabricated metal parts suffer from a residual porosity, relatively rough and uneven surface, columnar grains of anisotropic properties and large tensile residual stresses in the near-surface layers [19–21]. These tensile residual stresses arising during the cooling stage of the manufacturing process were regarded as a key factor responsible for the distortion and even delamination of the end-products [20]. Moreover, the dimensional and orientation heterogeneities of the grain structure of the layers were observed [22–24]. The effects of the treatment strategy and the SLM parameters, such as laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing, build orientation, and layer thickness on the mechanical and operational properties of Inconel 718 (IN 718) alloy were also addressed [17,25,26]. It is known that the nickel-based IN 718 alloy widely used in aerospace, oil, and defense industries owing to its capacity to retain high mechanical properties at elevated temperatures $( < 6 5 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ . Good corrosion resistance and prolonged fatigue life [27–29] can also be achieved by AM processes. The operational properties of nickel-based superalloys were concluded to be essentially suffered due to the occurrence of the SLM-manufacturing defects. Therefore, the improvement of the surface roughness, porosity, microstructure, and residual stress state of the IN 718 parts fabricated by the SLM process becomes especially relevant.",

    "content": "Currеntlу, various mechanical surface treatments such as a laser shock peening (LSP) [30], shot peening (SP) [31], cavitation peening (CP) [32], surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) [33], ultrasonic shot peening (USP) [34], ultrasonic impact treatment (UIT) [35], and barrel finishing (BF) [36] аrе widely used fоr surface engineering of both large-scale and small-sized metal components. Modification of thеir near-surface layers induced by surface plastic deformation allows providing the required surface microrelief, increased surface hardness, and compressive residual macrostress. For instance, the LSP involves the generation of severe surface plastic deformation on the treated specimen due to the plasma-induced shock waves. Conversely, other processes consist of random (SMAT, USP or BF) or directional (SP) bombarding the certain area of the treated surface by high-energy balls/shots. The UIT process also provides severe plastic deformation of the treated surface but by means of multiple impactions by several cylindrical pins. The specific energy accumulated in the modified surface layer can be variated in a wide interval by changing the processes' parameters. It is also important to account for the possibilities of various post-processing techniques with regard to the shape and size of the processed parts/specimens. Thus, they can be applied for mechanical post-processing of the small-sized (SP, SMAT, LSP, USP, and BF), largescale (SP, LSP, and UIT), and complex-shape (SP, SMAT, LSP, USP, BF, and CP) parts. Additionally, the BF process or vibratory/magnetic finishing allows surface treatment of the SLM-built parts without fixturing. The above-mentioned methods have some reservations but most of them can be applied to ensure the enhanced corrosion/wear resistance and fatigue life of the SLM-built components.",

    "content": "Several ultrasonically driven mechanical surface treatments, such as mono-pin UIT process [8], multi-pin UIT process [11], and ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification (UNSM) [9,37], were recently used to enhance the surface properties of the SLM produced components made of $3 1 6 \\mathrm { L }$ steel, Ti-6Al-4 V, and ALSi10Mg alloys. It was shown that the surface roughness, residual tensile stress, and porosity can be largely reduced, the epitaxial growth of columnar grains can be prevented, and the surface hardness can be increased owing to the application of the ultrasonic surface deformation at the intermediate stages of the SLM process. The multi-pin UIT process is considered to be more effective and applicable in industrial scales, as the conventional SP process. It was shown to improve both the surface roughness and hardness of the surface layer of uniform hardening depth [38,39]. However, based on the practical application, the LSP, BF, USP or SP techniques can be more effective for post-processing of the small-sized and complex-shape metal parts.\n\nAn improvement of the surface characteristics of the SLM-fabricated AlSi10Mg parts after the UNSM, SP, and LSP processes was confirmed [40–42], and the SP-induced diminution in the overall relative subsurface porosity led to an increase in low- and high-cycle fatigue resistance [42]. Moreover, a reduction in surface imperfections by combined post-processing methods (heat treatment $^ +$ sandblasting, heat treatment $+ \\ S \\mathrm { p }$ , sand/glass blasting $^ +$ electro/plasma polishing) can also enhance the surface properties of the SLM-built specimens [43,44]. It was also confirmed that the wear resistance of the as-built specimen made of 17-4 stainless steel or $\\mathbf { A l S i 1 0 M g }$ alloy was improved after the SP process [12]. At the same time, the attempts to use the mechanical surface treatments to improve the surface properties of the SLM-fabricated IN 718 alloy parts are virtually absent.",

The 3D assessment of surface texture parameters was estimated by the arithmetic mean height $( S a )$ the maximum peak height $( S p )$ , the maximum valley height $( S \\nu )$ and the maximum height $( S z )$ of the surface irregularities (Fig. 5).\n\nAs usual, the morphology of the side surfaces of SLM-built specimen contains a large number of manufacturing defects, such as ellipsoidal/ spherical balls or shrinkage cavities, partially melted powder particles or spattering powder particles, open pores, and signs of the laser tracks (Figs. 3a,b, and 4a–d) [57]. In addition to that, the surface is rough (Sz parameter is ${ \\sim } 6 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ having the irregularities of relatively high height (Figs. 3, 5). It is seen that the partially melted metal powder or spatters (indicated by arrows in Fig. 4b) are adhered to the surface specimen because of their existence inside the heat-affected zone [40]. Fig. 4c shows a general view of balling that formed alongside the surface via a segmentation effect of the elongated melt pool [52]. The balling phenomenon is usually formed during the SLM process when the molten pool becomes discontinuous and breaks into separated islands via a shrinking tendency to decrease the surface energy under the action of surface tension. Additionally, the unmolten powder particles were found in the near-surface layer (indicated by arrows in Fig. 4d). As a result, above-mentioned defects essentially deteriorate surface integrity. In order to reduce or eliminate surface defects, the surface mechanical methods are usually applied [45–48,50–53].",

As compared to the SP process $( S a = 6 . 6 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , $S z = 5 6 . 7 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ , UIT forms regular microrelief with a smoother surface (the $\\scriptstyle { S z }$ parameter is ${ \\sim } 2 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ and lower surface waviness owing to the application of the multi-pin ultrasonic tool, which produces the sliding impacts of pins by the specimen surface due to forced rotation of the impact head [38] (Figs. 3 and 5). The registered UIT-caused $s a$ parameter becomes twice lower than that of the SLM-built specimen. It is also important to point out that the dimpled surface microreliefs formed by USP and SP are significantly different due to the fact that the balls driven by the directional compressed air flow in the case of the SP process hit nearly perpendicular to the treated surface, while in the case of the USP process the balls impacted the treated surface in random angles owing to their chaotic motion inside the USP-chamber. Therefore, in contrast to USP, the SP-induced surface relief is more significantly affected by the shot speed. Additionally, a larger diameter of the shot media and multidirectional character of impacts in the case of USP can be the reason of slightly decreased surface texture parameters as compared to that formed after SP (Fig. 5). This result also correlates well with the literature data [53]. The reduction in the surface texture parameters and the modification homogeneity induced by SP and USP could be increased when the higher-energy shots would be applied for a longer time [54].",

    "content": "From the quality point of view of the SLM-printed metal parts of a high level of residual porosity require additional post-processing, for instance by the methods of severe plastic deformation, to eliminate or diminish the residual porosity at least in the near-surface layers. The results of a statistical analysis of the area fractions and size distributions of residual pores show that the surface porosity percentage is decreased irrespective of the treatment method used (Figs. 9). Pores of different size were observed in the specimens along the build direction. The smallest size of pores was registered after the USP and UIT processes due to effective pores closure induced by severe plastic deformation of high strain rate and high extent supplemented by ultrasonic action [56]. Based on the quantitative porosity analysis, the residual porosity values after USP and UIT processes were respectively decreased by 55 and $8 4 \\%$ as compared to the SLM-built specimen (Fig. 9). Compared to the USP process, the UIT process significantly decreases and virtually removes the near-surface porosity, forming a deeper densified layer $( \\sim 2 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ . It is seen that spherical ball or unmelted powder (Fig. 8a) is deformed by the multi-pin ultrasonic tool (Fig. 8f). As a result, the smallest number of pores was observed after the UIT process $( 0 . 1 1 8 \\% )$ , which seems to be fully eliminated if the higher oscillation amplitude and/or treatment duration would be used (Figs. 6–8). It was also shown in our earlier studies that multi-pin UIT can result in effective pores closure in the treated surface layer of the powder metallurgy Ti6Al4V alloy [35]. Recently, Wang et al.

The $\\mathrm { H V } _ { 0 . 0 2 5 }$ magnitudes achieve ${ \\sim } 4 5 0$ , ${ \\sim } 4 8 0$ , ${ \\sim } 5 9 0$ , and ${ \\sim } 6 5 0$ after BF, USP, UIT, and SP, respectively. The microhardness of the surface layers of the BF and USP processed specimens are higher than that of the SLM-built specimen by $\\sim 1 5 . . .$ $2 5 \\%$ . At the same time, as compared to the SLM-built specimen $( 4 1 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ , the crystallite size in the near-surface layer was found slightly decreased after BF $( \\sim 3 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ and USP $( \\sim 2 3 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ , respectively, The UIT process led to a $5 0 \\%$ increase in the near-surface hardness, forming the crystallite size of ${ \\sim } 1 5 ~ { \\mu } \\mathrm { m }$ , as compared to the untreated SLM-built specimen, while the SP-induced surface microhardness is approximately $1 0 \\%$ higher than that of the UIT-processed specimen.

Residual stress\nFrom point of view of desirable prolonged operation life of the SLMbuilt parts, the sign and magnitude of residual stresses are additional critical characteristics. In this study, they were assessed using the X-ray stress analysis. Considering the residual stress magnitudes formed in the subsurface layers of the studied specimens, the tensile residual stresses formed in the SLM-built specimen $\\mathrm { ( + 1 2 0 ~ M P a ) }$ ) because of the large thermal gradients occurred near the laser spot during rapid heating and cooling of the molten pool (Fig. 11) [21] were successfully eliminated by post-processing techniques. Moreover, the residual stresses formed by post-processing techniques are of the compressive character.\n\n![](images/7cea315956fd17160edfd01721ea1561db2da8b41d138de3e638e9f43bdbf632.jpg)  \nFig. 7.

    "content": "The experimental results presented above (Figs. 3, 4) have indicated that the surface of SLM-fabricated parts contains a large number of manufacturing defects (surface balls, partially melted or sputtered powder particles, shrinkage cavities and/or open pores), which are usual for the SLM manufactured parts [25,40]. Various SLM parameters (laser energy density, hatch spacing, scanning speed) were shown to affect the surface topography of the IN 718 parts [25]. For instance, the balling effect (needle-like tips and deep pits) was decreased at a higher energy density. It was concluded that lower hatch spacing allowed producing the parts with smoother surfaces [57]. The results of this study, as well as some literature data [8,9,13,14] show that mechanical post-processing of the SLM-built parts can be another effective technological solution. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) of the treated surfaces can be able to reduce the manufacturing defects, although mainly in the near-surface layers. Often, it is enough to improve the surface characteristics of the SLM-built parts to meet the stringent requirements in various engineering applications.\n\n![](images/c034da2f6a9e53ab812ae8ed0bd708282345d88871bceaead14c673d869735db.jpg)  \nFig. 9.

    "content": "Changes in the surface roughness parameters (Fig. 5) observed in this study well correlate to the appropriate literature data [13,37,40–42]. In particular, the SP process caused the almost $5 0 \\%$ reduction in the surface roughness of SLM-built AlSi10Mg specimen $( R a \\ = \\ 1 1 . 9 6 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ [40]. However, as compared to the machined or machined-and-polished surfaces, the SP processed surface acquired the increased roughness magnitudes [41]. On the other hand, such postprocessing techniques as a media blasting, tumbling, LSP, and UNSM were shown to improve the surface texture of the SLM-fabricated metal components. It is also important that the multi-pin UIT process can results in a regular surface microrelief with lower surface waviness and roughness as compared to those formed after SP, and USP, which produce random impacts of high-energy balls by the components surface [38,39,47].\n\nThe extent of the roughness changes induced by different postprocessing mechanical techniques can be illustrated with respect to the accumulated impact energy $E$ (Table 3) using Fig. 12. Generally, it can be concluded that all mechanical surface treatments applied in this study are very effective for improving the surface microrelief parameters of the SLM-built parts – the surface roughness linearly decreases with accumulating energy, which correlates to the surface deformation extent (Table 3). Only data related to the SP-processed specimen $( E \\approx 3 . 1 5 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m ^ { 2 } } )$ ) stand out of the linear dependence that can be explained by the impacting features – the SP-induced impacts are directed perpendicularly to the treated surface, and thus they induce higher acquired roughness. The presented data can be easily used to choose optimal regimes of other mechanical surface treatments provided the $E$ would be known.",

It is seen that the SLM-built surface is relatively smooth without a lot of intrusions and extrusions (Fig. 13, a1), which correlates well to the surface topography shown in Fig. 3, a. However, it contains numerous partially melted powder particles attached to the surface (Fig. 13, a1–a3) and some portion of the shrinkage cavities (Fig. 13, a1, a2). The surface topographies after mechanical post-processing (Fig. 13, b1–d1) become smoother with the increased accumulated energy applied. Still, some deformed particles are seen in the BF-processed (Fig. 13, b1) and USP processed (Fig. 13, c1) surfaces. Conversely, the SP (Fig. 13, d1) and UIT (Fig. 13, e1) modified surfaces are almost completely free from such manufacturing defects. Only some residuals of surface filaments can be seen (Fig. 13, d2, e2).\n\nFinally, when the complex-shape or small-sized products need to be treated one should account for more convenience and higher productivity of the BF, USP, LSP, SP, media blasting and tumbling processes with regard to the multi-pin UIT process. In particular, SP, USP, and LSP are usually used to treat the turbine blades, aircraft wings, and other curved surfaces to reduce aerodynamic drag as the dimpled surfaces are known to have a lesser aerodynamic drag than that of extremely smooth surfaces.",

According to the literature data, the manufacturing defects may play the role of stress risers, and they thus may reduce the fatigue life and wear resistance of the fabricated metal components [27,41]. For instance, the SLM-built AlSi7Mg specimen having $1 \\%$ of porosity demonstrated the fatigue life decreased by $5 0 \\%$ in comparison with that of the dense alloy [42]. The most frequent sites for fatigue cracks' initiations are pores (Fig. 14) or unmelted particles in the near-surface area irrespective of the load conditions or stress state [28]. It should be noted that as compared to the gas (spherical) pores, the aspherical pores cause a significant deterioration of mechanical properties of the material due to their larger size [14,25,26,42].\n\nTo minimize the porosity optimum regimens for SLM process can be found and used.

These parameters are naturally very important in consideration of the SLM-built parts and they were analyzed in the literature.\n\nIt is known that one of the possible ways to minimize residual stress at the SLM process is a variation of the scanning strategy [17,24,27]. A scanning strategy is chosen depends on the part geometry. The stripe or chessboard scanning strategies are suitable for parts with thicker sections. Above-mentioned scanning strategies can generate a homogeneous distribution of residual stresses via shorter scan vectors.

In addition to that, it was revealed that the tensile residual stresses in the SLM-built specimen $( 1 7 6 . 3 \\mathrm { M P a } )$ ) can be reduced after UIT (49.9 MPa). Recently, the LSP process combined with the SLM process was implemented to decrease/eliminate the thermal residual stresses during the SLM process [10]. Moreover, work by Damon et al.

Some of these characteristics (roughness, porosity) were decreased after application of the post-processing techniques, but the others (HV, residual stresses, and penetration depth) were increased/enhanced. An appropriate mechanical method can be chosen accounting for this data and considering the applicability of various techniques for post-processing of the small-sized, large-scale, and complex-shape parts (see the ‘versatility’ parameter in Fig. 17).\n\nIt is also important to take a controllability/convenience and cost/ time consuming of intermediate mechanical surface treatments into account. The BF (or media blasting and tumbling) and SP (or cavitation peening, USP, LSP) processes are rather controllable/flexible, but they can be used predominantly for surface finishing of the SLM-built products. Conversely, the UIT, UNSM or LSP processes can provide local treatment both at the intermediate stages (every several SLM-built layers) and after the end of the SLM-process. However, they need more effort to meet the precision requirements before including them to the SLM-manufacturing routes used for complex-shape components [10]. Additionally, as compared to the SP and cavitation peening, the LSP process is known to be more expensive. Nevertheless, the LSP process can provide individually controlled shots and the deeper layers compressed by residual stress [9].",

    "content": "Application of the mechanical post-processing techniques, such as SP [12,43], LSP [10], mono-pin UIT [8,61], multi-pin UIT [11,38,39], UNSM [19,37], to the SLM-built parts allow reducing both superficial and structural defects, ensuring the surface hardening and compressing of the surface layers of the parts. Therefore, such a technological solution allows manufacturing the complex products for the aerospace industry without changing their design or material, but only by applying additional mechanical post-processing to improve their operational properties.\n\nType of appropriate post-processing technique can be chosen based on the analysis of the shape and dimensions of the part to be treated. While the regimes of the chosen post-processing treatments can be determined, accounting for the extents of the surface roughness reduction, manufacturing defects and porosity eliminations, hardening/ compressing, and the thickness of modified layers (see Fig. 17).\n\nThe BF, SP, USP, and UIT processes applied in this study to improve the IN 718 alloy specimens manufactured by the SLM process demonstrated a good efficiency for modification of the surface topography, porosity, hardness and residual stress. The obtained results allow drawing the following conclusions:\n\n• In comparison with the SLM-built state the surface roughness $( S a = 5 . 2 7 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ of the post-processed specimens were respectively decreased by $2 0 . 6 \\%$ , $2 6 . 2 \\%$ , and $5 7 . 4 \\%$ after the BF, USP, and UIT processes except for the SP-treated ones.

    "content": "The laser process parameters used in selective laser melting (SLM) affect the mode of melting and the process characteristics such as the porosity. Some parameters may have a higher effect on the single-track characteristics than the others. This study aims at determining both the individual and combined effects of laser parameters on the single-track geometry and porosity for Inconel 625 alloy powder. The single tracks with linear energy densities (LED) ranging from 0.16 to $0 . 9 8 \\mathrm { J / m m }$ are fabricated to explore the effect of LED on melting modes and the keyhole porosity. A micro-CT scanner is used to measure the pores formed inside the tracks, and the results showed that the porosity increased with an increase in LED in the keyhole mode. Besides, metallography is performed to reveal the transverse melt pool boundary and to differentiate the melting modes. The transverse melt pool boundary shows that the depth of the melt pool increases significantly compared to the width with an increase in LED, which signifies the change in the melting from the conduction to keyhole mode. Further, another set of experiments is performed by using different combinations of laser power and scan speed from the same LEDs of $0 . 4 8 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m }$ and $0 . 7 5 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m }$ . The melt pool boundary shows that within the same LED, the depth of the melt pool increases significantly with an increase in the laser power. However, for the same LED, the single-track porosity increased up to a certain level; then, the porosity decreased with the further increase in the power and speed. The physics behind such phenomenon is explained by the particle-level SLM process simulations developed using FLOW-3D. The simulation results show that the change in the melting mode from the conduction to keyhole for the same LED is due to the increased vaporization with an increase in the laser power, which enhanced the vapor pressure.",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is a layer-wise fabrication process which enables the production of complex geometries. Selective laser melting (SLM) is a powder bed AM process that uses metal powder as the feedstock material. During the SLM process, the metal powder is spread over the build platform layer by layer, and the laser is used to melt the powder particles selectively to form a designed part. SLM process has been used to produce parts from different materials. Gu et al. [1] investigated the densification behavior and microstructure evolution of pure titanium, while Leuders et al. [2] studied the fatigue resistance and crack growth performance of TI6Al4V manufactured by SLM process. Moreover, Li et al. [3] studied the balling behavior of stainless steel and nickel powder during the SLM process.\n\nAlthough the SLM process has shown its freeform capability, the variability induced by the process itself impedes the establishment of a process standard as described by Monzón et al. [4]. The process variables include laser power, scan speed, hatch spacing, powder size distribution, layer thickness, ambient pressure, inert atmosphere, etc. Lee et al. [5] have used a data analytics approach to find the correlation between different parameters with the melt pool properties such as track width, depth, etc. The results showed that the depth and width of melt pool are physically relevant with the laser penetration, and fluid convection, respectively.",

    "content": "The single-track studies are mostly used to observe the track morphology and the melt pool boundary. Yadroitsev et al. [6] analyzed the SLM single tracks formed with metal powders and showed that there exist stability and instability zones. Dilip et al. [7] discussed the effect of laser parameters on the melt pool shape and size and used a transverse melt pool boundary to distinguish the modes of melting. The shape of the melt pool boundary formed in the conduction mode is usually semi-circular, and the depth is close to the half-width of the track. However, the depth is higher than the half-width of the track in the keyhole mode melting, as explained by King et al. [8]. Cunningham et al. [9] used ultrahigh-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging to observe the melt pool formation during the SLM process. Such experiments enable the realtime observation of the development of vapor depression. The authors concluded based on the power density that there is a well-defined threshold from conduction mode to keyhole. Similarly, Martin et al. [10] studied the dynamics of the pore formation during the SLM process. In situ X-ray imaging was utilized to understand the formation of vapor depression, and the effect of laser power on the depression depth was assessed. The results indicated that under steady-state scan conditions, the vapor depression increases linearly with the laser power, and the pores are formed due to the collapse of the keyhole wall. Besides, Shrestha and Chou [11] showed that the numerical simulations could be used to understand the characteristics of the conduction mode melting and keyhole mode melting.",

Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT)-based studies help to detect and characterize internal pores formed during the SLM process. Shrestha et al. [13] and Thanki et al. [14] performed the single-track experiments and utilized the microCT to characterize the keyhole pores formed inside the tracks. The size of the keyhole pores depends on the process parameter used, and the keyhole porosity increase with the increase in the linear energy density (LED). Most of the studies used the energy density, a thermodynamic quantity, to characterize the single tracks and part quality. However, Bertoli et al. [15] explained that the melt pool characteristics in the laser material processing depend on the process parameters such as laser power, scan speed, and beam diameter and material properties such as surface absorption, thermal conductivity, and thermal diffusivity. Hence, it is important to include material properties while analyzing the track property. Hann et al. [16] incorporated the effect of the material properties and suggested that the weld profiles in the laser welding are related to the peak enthalpy of the weld pool.",

Figure 5 a shows the 3D image of a typical cylinder sample obtained after the CT image reconstruction. The grayscale image is based on the density of the sample. The light gray region is the solid In625, dark gray contained inside the cylinder is the In625 powder, and the black region represents the void. A transverse section of the sample is shown in Fig. 5b. Three tracks are identified based on the surface profile, and one of the tracks shows the formation of the pore inside the track. Besides, the density-based transfer function is modified to remove the powder material inside, and the 3D clipping is performed to observe the single track formed over the base, as shown in Fig. 5c. This feature enables the comparison of the surface morphologies formed with different laser parameters.\n\nFigure 6 presents the micro-CT image of the keyhole pores formed with $0 . 9 8 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m }$ LED along the scan direction.

    "content": "The pores formed inside the single tracks are measured, and Fig. 7 presents the average pore quantities from three replicates for all the investigated LEDs. The error bar indicates the standard deviation from three replicates of the single tracks. In general, the single-track porosity increased with the increase in LED, and the maximum porosity is observed at the LED of $0 . 9 0 \\mathrm { J / m m }$ . The increase in porosity is related to the formation of the keyhole due to the increase in energy density. However, the highest LED of $0 . 9 8 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m }$ resulted in a lower average pore number and volume compared to $0 . 9 0 { } \\mathrm { J } / { }$ mm.\n\n![](images/b7ed0394ddddb7a3d2808d5bdd3d6321b0d943f3a21bc5e6c68a1dce1765f431.jpg)  \nFig. 5 a CT-scanned cylinder after reconstruction, b transverse cross section, and c modification of the transfer function to remove the powder particles and observe the single tracks\n\nIt is also noted that the number of pores formed with the same LEDs are smaller for IN625 with $4 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ layer thickness compared to the Ti-6Al-4 V experiment with $3 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ layer thickness performed by Shrestha et al. [13]. The data analytical study showed that the small variation in the layer thickness has minimal effect on the melt pool depth [9]. Hence, such a difference in the pore number and pore volume may be due to the difference in the thermal properties between the two materials. This difference in the melt pool characteristics between different materials shows the importance of including the material properties while establishing the relationship between energy density and melting modes.\n\n![](images/0d0d24ceaa76204ce4e3d2df3aa8f97b7035f0926b04d96970cafb0e126aebc2.jpg)  \nFig. 6 2D and 3D pores formed with keyhole parameters (195 W and $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s }$ )",

    "content": "The pore diameter and depth are also a function of LED. The average depth of and the standard deviation of the keyhole pores formed at different LEDs are shown in Fig. 8. The pore depth increased with the increase in LED, which may be due to the increase in keyhole depth formed with increasing LEDs. Besides, the average pore size also increased with an increase in LED. The increase in the size may be related to the size of the vapor opening, which is bigger at higher LED.\n\nThe pore depth measurements suggested that deeper melt pools are formed with higher LEDs. Hence, the single-track samples are cut in the middle of the track to obtain the transverse melt pool boundaries and differentiate the melting modes. The samples are polished and then etched with modified Kalling’s reagent ( $4 0 ~ \\mathrm { m l }$ distilled water $+ 4 8 0 \\ \\mathrm { m l \\ H C l + }$ $4 8 \\ \\mathrm { m g \\ C u c l 2 }$ ) to reveal the melt pool boundary. Figure 9 shows the transverse melt pool boundary formed with different LEDs. The depth of the melt pool increased with the LED. For a constant power, the width and depth of the melt pool decreased with an increase in speed due to the decrease in the interaction time. However, for the same speed, the depth increased with power due to the increase in the laser penetration.\n\n![](images/f5f4d3273100f6d4cb5ba09f81cac2543e9bd75b0e1e5cc8a8bb9d2702932774.jpg)  \nFig. 7 Pore volume and pore number from different LEDs",

    "content": "The melt pool dimensions of the single tracks are measured from the transverse profile. Figure 10 shows the measurement approach of the track width and depth and the relationship between LED and track width and depth. The track width and depth increased with increasing LED. However, the increase in depth is significant compared to the width. The width of the track is higher than the depth for all the conduction mode melting, while the depth is higher than the width for the deep keyhole mode melting. A second-order polynomial curve is fitted to both depth and width, which shows that the depth is increasing almost linearly with LED. However, the width of the track increased with an increase in LED within conduction mode but did not show an obvious increase within the keyhole regime. The maximum width of the track may be limited by the beam diameter and increasing the energy density with the same beam diameter may increase the depth rather than width after reaching a certain limit. There are some cases where the higher LED resulted in the shallower melt pool. The LED of $0 . 5 3 \\mathrm { J / m m }$ ( $1 0 5 \\mathrm { W }$ and $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s }$ ) resulted in the depth lower than $0 . 4 9 \\ \\mathrm { J / m m }$ ( $\\cdot 9 5 ~ \\mathrm { W }$ and $4 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s } ,$ ). This behavior may be due to the significant difference in the power between the two LEDs. However, the LED of $0 . 9 8 \\ J /$ mm (195 and $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s }$ ) also resulted in shallower melt pool compared to the LED of $0 . 9 0 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m }$ ( $1 8 0 ~ \\mathrm { W }$ and $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ ), although $0 . 9 8 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m }$ had a higher power. Such anomaly may be due to the variation in the melt pool depth during the keyhole melting. The longitudinal metallography should be performed to obtain the variation in depth along the laser travel direction.",

The LED of $0 . 4 8 \\mathrm { J / m m }$ resulted in fewer pores compared to the $0 . 7 5 \\mathrm { J / m m }$ . Besides, the porosity increased with an increase in power for both LEDs. However, the porosity was not maximum for the highest power. The numerical study [11] showed that the formation of the keyhole pores is due to instabilities in the keyhole wall caused by the interplay between surface tension pressure and recoil pressure. Within the keyhole mode at the same energy density, the increase in power would increase the radius of the vapor opening. At a certain point, the instability between the surface tension and vapor opening leads to the formation of many pores due to the collapse of the keyhole wall. However, with further increase in the power, the keyhole opening is large enough so that the surface tension pressure is unable to close the keyhole wall, leading to a stable keyhole. This reduces the chance of the pore formation. For the same LED, the mode of melting changed from incomplete to conduction and finally to keyhole with increasing power and speed.",

    "content": "The surface morphology and the respective transverse melt profile of the single tracks formed with different levels of power and scan speed from LED of $0 . 4 8 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m }$ are shown in Fig. 12. At a low power, that is $2 4 ~ \\mathrm { W }$ , discontinuous track is formed. The discontinuity corresponds to the insufficient melting, which is usually the case with very low LEDs. In this case, even if the LED is high, the power is very low. Hence, the low power resulted in the lower melt pool temperature, and consequently, the laser penetration was insufficient to form a continuous single track. As the power and speed are increased, continuous tracks are formed. The melt pool depth slowly increased within the conduction modes from $4 8 \\mathrm { ~ W ~ }$ and $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m m / s }$ to $9 6 \\mathrm { W }$ and $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s }$ . However, there is a sudden increase in the depth when the laser power increased to $1 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { W }$ , suggesting the keyhole mode melting. Figure 12 reveals a clear evolution of the melting modes from the incomplete to the conduction mode and finally to the keyhole mode melting with an increase in the laser power and scan speed at the same energy density. Although the depth of the melt pool increased with increasing power and speed, the average volume and number of pores were not maximum for the maximum speed and power used. This shows that the porosity is not directly related to the depth of the keyhole, rather its occurrence depends on the stability of the keyhole formed, during the melting process. Besides the depth of the melt pool, the width of the track also increased with an increase in the power and speed from incomplete melting to the keyhole melting. However, the track width did not show an obvious increase with the increase in power within the keyhole mode, which is consistent with the result obtained in the LED effect study discussed in the previous section.",

However, it is important to note that the depth would change along the longitudinal direction and the melt pool profile taken at a single transverse direction may sometimes lead to dubious comparisons.

Figure 14 presents the two examples of the longitudinal melt pool boundaries obtained with $0 . 4 8 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m }$ (120 W, $2 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ , and $1 4 4 \\mathrm { ~ W ~ }$ , $3 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s } )$ , and two with $0 . 7 5 \\ \\mathrm { J / m m } \\ ( 1 3 1 \\ \\mathrm { W } , 1 7 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ and 150 W, $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s }$ ).

    "content": "The depth to width ratio shows that the conduction mode melting occurred up to $9 6 \\mathrm { W }$ laser power and $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m / s }$ scan speed, which corresponded to the normalized enthalpy of 5.5. As the power and speed increased to $1 2 0 \\mathrm { W }$ and $2 5 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s }$ , the depth to half-width ratio became greater than 1, suggesting a formation of a keyhole for which the corresponding enthalpy is around 6. In this case, the transition from the conduction to the keyhole mode melting is observed to be around $\\Delta H / h _ { \\mathrm { s } } { = } 6$ . Two lines are drawn to distinguish the keyhole modes based on the normalized depth and the depth to width ratios. The horizontal line is drawn for a depth ratio of 1, which would separate the keyhole parameters based on the depth to halfwidth ratio. The vertical line separates the keyhole parameters based on the normalized enthalpy. The use of enthalpy as a design parameter is, therefore, a simple approach to identify the process parameters as the keyhole or the conduction parameters. The frequency of the pore formation is lower for $1 3 1 \\mathrm { ~ W ~ }$ , hence resulted in the fewer pore number compared to the 150 W power.\n\nAs the power has more effect on the depth than the speed, it is expected to have differences in the depth with the change in the level of power and speed, even if the LED is kept constant. Besides, laser power has more effect on the peak temperature of the melt pool during the SLM process, and the temperature increases with an increase in power. Numerical models may be used to predict the real-time temperature and flow of the melt pool, which determines the shape of the melt pool boundary. Hence, a micro-scale numerical model is developed to predict the melt pool formation with different levels of power and speed.",

At low power (48 W and $7 2 \\mathrm { ~ W ~ } ,$ , the melting occurs purely by conduction. The heat absorbed by the free surface exposed to the laser is diffused to the substrate, which melts the material beneath, forming a shallow melt pool. The temperature profile shows that the temperature is higher than the boiling temperature for some region; however, the vaporization is not enough to generate the substantial vapor pressure to form a depression. The melt pool formed by the pure conduction is very shallow, with the depth to width ratio being well below 1. For the laser power of $9 2 \\mathrm { ~ W ~ }$ , a depression is formed, leading to a deeper melt pool. However, it is not regarded as the keyhole mode melting in this study as the depth to half-width ratio about 1. The vapor opening has a larger diameter and remains open all the time; hence, the possibility of the pore formation due to the collapse of the vapor opening is minimal. When the power is increased to $1 2 0 \\mathrm { W }$ , the region with a temperature greater than the evaporation temperature is very high, and the material evaporation exerts the recoil pressure forming a keyhole. Hence, the shape of the transverse profile is determined by the shape of the keyhole.

    "content": "The mode of melting progressed from conduction to keyhole with increasing LED. The depth of the keyhole and the porosity mostly increased with increasing energy density. However, the maximum porosity was obtained at $0 . 9 0 \\ \\mathrm { J / m m }$ (180 W, $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ ) instead of the highest LED investigated, i.e., $0 . 9 8 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m }$ obtained with $1 9 5 \\mathrm { ~ W ~ }$ , $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } / \\mathrm { s }$ . & The melt pool boundaries obtained from the $0 . 4 8 ~ \\mathrm { J / m m }$ LED parameters show that the depth of the melt pool increased consistently with the increase in laser power. The level of power determines the mode of melting for the same LED. However, the keyhole porosity did not increase with an increase in the melt pool depth, instead, the keyhole porosity increased to a certain level and then decreased with further increase in laser power. & The numerical results show that the increase in the melt pool depth is due to the increase in the melt pool temperature and the vapor pressure. There is a significant increase in penetration with a small increase in laser power due to the exponential relationship between the recoil pressure and the surface temperature. The vapor opening in the conduction mode is stable, and the instability in the keyhole becomes evident with an increase in the depth of the keyhole. LED may not be used as a sole parameter to distinguish the mode of melting as the laser power has a greater effect on melt pool depth than the scan speed. Normalized enthalpy, which includes process parameters as well as material properties, may be more appropriate to explain the shifting from conduction to keyhole mode melting.\n\nAcknowledgements Sabina Chertmanova assisted with CT scanning and reconstruction of tested samples.\n\nFunding This research is partially supported by NSF, Advanced Manufacturing Program (Award # 1662662).",

This approach overlooks the fact that historically, many engineering alloy system has been designed with a particular processing route in mind, e.g., ingot metallurgy, powder metallurgy, rapid quenching, etc. There are thus significant opportunities to design alloys specifically for AM. A key challenge is that alloy design requires performance metrics that can be optimized by exploring the alloy chemistry space. Here, we present a study in which we examine how intrinsic thermophysical properties can be used to estimate performance metrics related to the behavior of a solidifying metal droplet under AM-relevant conditions. By identifying these intrinsic properties, it is possible to directly incorporate ‘intrinsic printability’, specifically ‘intrinsic resistance to balling’, into AM-focused alloy design.",

    "content": "The design of alloys for powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing (AM) must be informed of the processing conditions that the specimen will be subjected to [1]. During PBF AM, alloys are exposed to large thermal gradients, complex thermal history, and rapid solidification conditions [2]. These processing conditions often result in printed parts with microstructures, properties, and performance that differ from specimens processed with conventional methods [3]. If processing parameters are not compatible with a particular alloy, the AMmanufactured artifact may experience several processing induced complications and defects such as residual internal stresses (leading to distortions and cracking), nonuniform melting and solidification (leading to hot tearing/cracking), vaporization of alloying components (leading to undesired stoichiometry in the alloy), unintentional trapping of gases within the solidifying alloy (i.e., keyholing), or incomplete wetting and spreading (leading to incomplete fusion of layers and balling) [3,4].\n\nTwo solutions have been proposed to remedy these complications: develop strategies to modify conventional alloys to be more amenable to AM and/or develop novel alloys using metrics for intrinsic printability as design constraints [3]. To date, the majority of research into metal AM has been framed in terms of the former solution. However, there remain significant opportunities to design alloys specifically for AM.",

    "content": "In the case of alloy design, the high cost of powder fabrication for AM severely restricts the experimental search for intrinsically printable alloys in an iterative manner. Prior knowledge of these alloys, captured in the form of printability indicators, must be leveraged to intelligently search for printable alloys across vast composition spaces. These printability indicators can be based on extrinsic factors, such as processing parameters, or intrinsic factors inherent to the alloy in question, such as solidification range and thermal diffusivity [5,6].\n\nResearch into the amenability of an alloy to AM has focused on combinations of extrinsic factors such as laser power, beam diameter, scan speed, or linear energy density (LED), defined as the laser power divided by the scan speed $( P / v )$ [7–11]. However, in recent years, more work has been done on identifying indicators for intrinsic printability. Of particular relevance to this work, Zhou et al. demonstrated that the balling phenomenon is a process in which the spreading and solidification of the alloy melt compete with each other, where the spreading and solidification behavior are determined by the intrinsic properties of the metal [12].",

Specifically, in Section 3 we perform CALPHAD calculations to estimate $\\tau _ { \\mathrm { s o l i d } } / \\tau _ { \\mathrm { s p r e a d } }$ across three exemplary ternary alloy systems, identifying regions in the ternary alloy space that are predicted to be resistant to balling as an exercise in alloy design for AM. In Section 4 we benchmark the proposed indicator against experimental data by accomplishing the following: We show that the proposed criterion is correlated with the size of the processing-parameter window with which an alloy can be printed without exhibiting balling; and we exploit said correlation by using the indicator as an informative feature in a machine-learning model that, given two simple features that capture laser parameters, is able to predict the probability of a balling with reasonable accuracy.",

    "content": "Printability indicators are properties that can screen for printable alloys in a high-throughput (HTP) manner. Mukherjee et al. [13] developed indicators based on both intrinsic alloy properties and PBF processing parameters. The authors related alloy properties to indicators for dimensional inaccuracy in printed parts, composition change due to vaporization of alloying components, and lack of fusion defects [13]. The Scheil-Gulliver curve and solidification range have been used as indicators of hot tearing, hot cracking, and compositional microsegregation; a wide solidification range has been shown to increase the chance of hot tearing and leads to greater compositional microsegregation during solidification [3,14–16]. Kou developed an indicator for hot cracking susceptibility based on the Scheil-Gulliver curve (i.e. temperature vs. solid fraction), where the derivative of temperature with respect to the square root of the solid fraction, $| d T / d ( f _ { S } ) ^ { 1 / 2 } |$ , corresponds to greater susceptibility to hot cracking [17]. A similar indicator, developed by Easton et al., is defined by the integral of the Scheil-Gulliver curve with respect to temperature from the coherency temperature (where liquid feeding is restricted) to the coalescence temperature (where a network of solid is formed), $\\int _ { T _ { o } } ^ { T _ { c o } } f _ { S } d T$ [18]. Recently, Du et al. have proposed a machine learning (ML) enabled balling susceptibility index based on 6 following mechanistic variables: volumetric energy density, Richardson number, pool aspect ratio, surface tension force, surface tension force, and solidification time [19]. These results rely on a ML-model trained on 166 experimental observations of PBF that capture the aforementioned mechanistic variables [19], whereas in this work we present a CALPHAD-based approach to determining intrinsic resistance to balling.",

    "content": "An analysis of the balling mechanism by Zhou et al. [12] revealed that during selective laser melting (SLM) of tungsten, the tendency for balling could be predicted by a simplified model in which melt spreading and solidification compete. When alloys solidify quickly and spread slowly, balling is more likely, as in the case of tungsten [12]. When alloys remain molten longer and spread quickly, balling is less likely, as in the case of titanium [12]. This simplified model has been used by Guo et al. [20] to explain balling in IN738LC superalloy. During 25 single track PBF experiments on IN738LC, balling was observed in 9 tracks; The estimated characteristic solidification time was less than the estimated spreading time for these 9 tracks whereas all continuous tracks had estimated spreading times less than the estimated solidification time. Likewise Liu et al. used the same simplified model to explain to explain balling resistance during PBF of AZ61 magnesium alloy [21]. The authors rank ordered AZ61 among several metals based on their their predicted resistance to balling, obtaining the following: $\\mathrm { T i } > \\mathrm { N i } >$ $\\mathbf { F e } > \\mathbf { A Z 6 } 1 > \\mathbf { M g } > \\mathbf { C u } .$ . The authors noted that if superheat is added to the melt pool the solidification time will increase relative to the spreading time and balling can be mitigated in AZ61. Despite this, Zhou’s model has yet to be used in HTP forward prediction of balling resistance.",

    "content": "This model is based on several assumptions, stated below. Building on the work of Schiaffino and Sonin [22], Zhou et al. [12] considered the case where a molten tungsten (W) droplet, with radius $a$ and temperature $T _ { o } ,$ is formed on a subcooled (held at $T _ { a }$ ) substrate of the same material as the droplet. Assuming isothermal deposition and spreading, the spherical droplet at time $t = 0$ will begin to wet the substrate while simultaneously solidifying. In the simplified case of homologous wetting on a flat surface where both solidification and oxidation are neglected, droplet spreading is characterized by the Weber number, and the Ohnesorge number, ???? = ?????? 2?? and $\\begin{array} { r } { Z = \\frac { \\mu } { \\sqrt { \\rho \\sigma a } } } \\end{array}$ respectively.

Additionally, during PBF droplets are sessile, meaning $W _ { e }$ would be $\\sim 0$ since $V = 0$ . For molten metals $Z$ is extremely small [12]. Low $W _ { e }$ and $Z$ indicate spreading is primarily driven by capillary flow [12].",

    "content": "The melt spreading and solidification timescales are determined by intrinsic alloy properties and laser processing parameters. The thermal timescales associated with the solidification of an alloy droplet, defined by Schiaffino and Sonin [22], 23], are split into two regimes, $\\tau _ { 1 }$ and $\\tau _ { 2 }$ . The first timescale, Eq. (1), represents the time required to remove superheat from the droplet, bringing it to its fusion temperature. The fusion temperature is assumed to be distinct [22,23], and is taken to be the solidus temperature in this work. The second timescale, Eq. (2), provides the time for the droplet to remove latent heat of fusion and solidify, where $a$ is the initial droplet radius, $\\alpha$ is thermal diffusivity, $k _ { a }$ is the thermal conductivity of the alloy at ambient temperature, $k$ is thermal conductivity at liquidus, $L$ is latent heat, $C$ is heat capacity, $T _ { f }$ and $T _ { 0 }$ are fusion (solidus) temperature and initial temperature, respectively [22,23]. In this work, $T _ { 0 }$ is defined as the liquidus, such that no superheat is added to the molten droplet. Ambient temperature, $T _ { a : }$ , is defined as $2 9 8 \\mathrm { K } ,$ approximating conditions for a single track experiment with no preheating and no previously printed layers. Characteristic timescales for solidification and spreading can be extracted from such a simulation. Following the convention of Zhou et al. the initial droplet radius are defined as $1 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ , common for SLM processing [12]. Both timescales rely on the simplification that heat exits the droplet by conduction via the underlying substrate. Eq. (3) predicts total solidification time, relating Eqs. (1) and (2). The timescale associated with the spreading of an alloy droplet can be estimated by Eq. (4), where $\\rho$ is the melt density, $a$ is initial droplet radius, and $\\sigma$ is the surface tension of the liquid [22,23].",

We consider the Ti-Al-V ternary as it contains Ti-6Al-4V, an alloy commonly used in AM. We consider the Nb-Ta-W system as an exemplary refractory system. Additionally, we consider the Fe-Ni-Cr system as it is the basis of Ni-based superalloys and stainless steels.

In the case of the Nb-Ta-W ternary, the intrinsic properties of tungsten make it difficult to print [12]. This is demonstrated in Fig. 1, where $\\tau _ { s o l i d } / \\tau _ { s p r e a d }$ is minimized (indicating susceptibility to balling) for compositions of Nb-Ta-W with greater W $\\mathbf { a t \\% }$ , however, by increasing the Nb content, the alloys within this ternary could be designed to be more amenable to AM. In fact, Nb has been shown experimentally to be much more ‘printable’ than W [24,25].\n\nIn a similar design exercise, we consider Inconel 718, a Fe-Ni-Cr based superalloy containing $\\mathbf { F e } _ { 1 8 . 6 } \\mathbf { N i } _ { 5 3 . 2 } \\mathbf { C r } _ { 2 0 . 7 }$ $\\left( \\mathsf { a t } \\% \\right)$ and ${ < } 7 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { a t } \\%$ minor alloying additions [26].

This is in agreement with studies on the AM of 316 stainless steel, where balling was indeed observed [27]. Likewise, within the Ti-Al-V ternary alloy system, Ti-6Al-4V, a commonly additively manufactured engineering alloy [7,28–30], falls in a printable region within the composition space, near $9 0 \\ \\mathrm { a t . } \\%$ Ti, again, demonstrating the utility of the proposed indicator in alloy design.",

The data is a combination of experimental results published in literature and experiments conducted in-house at Texas A&M University. A subset of the database (alloys assessed in Thermo-Calc TCHEA5, TINI11, and TCAL7 databases), comprised of 2527 unique alloy-process observations and 158 unique compositions, was used to conduct the experimental validation of the indicator. Specifically, these 2527 observations are PBF experiments using pre-alloyed powders. The experiments were performed on various machines with different printing environments, initial powder bed temperatures, powder particle size distributions, atmospheres, and build geometries; The following work does not account for these factors as they are not well populated in the database. The alloys represented in the database spanned over 11 material systems including stainless steels, aluminum-based alloys, nickel-based alloys, and high entropy alloys [12,27,31–121].

From such a visualization one could conclude there are no alloys within the database that contain between $2 0 \\mathrm { w t . } \\%$ and $4 0 \\mathrm { w t . } \\%$ Al, rather, if Al is present in an alloy it is present below $2 0 \\mathrm { w t . } \\%$ , between $4 0 \\mathrm { w t . } \\%$ and $6 0 \\mathrm { w t . } \\%$ or at $8 0 \\mathrm { w t . } \\%$ and above.

Fig. 2c depicts a uniform manifold Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). UMAP is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique [122]. In this UMAP projection alloys that are compositionally similar are plotted closer to each other in the 2D projection. This results in clusters of alloys and alloy systems. Alloy systems (clusters not containing a single alloy) are labeled in italics while clusters of specific alloys are not.

    "content": "To predict balling within the alloy-processing parameter space, the alloy space is encoded by $\\tau _ { s o l i d } / \\tau _ { s p r e a d }$ and the processing parameter space is encoded by LED and dwell time. Using $\\tau _ { s o l i d } / \\tau _ { s p r e a d }$ , laser dwell time, and LED as features, common Scikit-Learn [123] classifiers were trained: Adaptive-Boosting model (referred to as AdaBoost) [124], Multi-layer Perceptron classifier (referred to as Neural Network) [125] and Gaussian Process classifier [126]. A 5-fold cross-validation was performed to avoid biases while benchmarking the classification models. In each training fold features were standardized prior to training. Of the 2496 observed alloy-processing parameter pairs, 321 resulted in balling while 2175 did not. To address this class imbalance, the minority class was over-sampled via the creation of synthetic examples in a data-operation known as synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) [127]. Plausible synthetic samples are created by considering each minority class entry and introducing synthetic entries along line segments connecting the k-nearest neighbors of the minority class in the feature space [127]. In addition to over-sampling the minority class, the majority class was randomly under-sampled, by recommendation of the authors of SMOTE [127]. SMOTE was applied during cross validation to all training folds while the test fold was left unaltered, ensuring no data-leakage between folds. In the context of this work, SMOTE results in the creation of synthetic balling entries with LED and dwell time values that are similar to entries that were observed to exhibit balling in reality. These data-operations resulted in a training set initially consisting of 270 balling entries and 1708 non-balling entries to contain 854 balling entries and 1708 non balling entries.",

In the case of this work, the AUC score indicates the probability that a classifier would assign a higher probability of balling to a randomly selected alloy-process parameter pair that exhibits balling than a randomly selected alloyprocess parameter pair that does not exhibit balling. To quantify the instances of false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), true positives (TP), and true negatives (TN) in the classifier predictions, precision, recall, and accuracy metrics were calculated. Precision, defined as, $P = T P / ( T P + F P )$ , captures the ability of the classifier to not label balling-resistant alloy-process pairs as balling-susceptible. Recall is defined as $R = ( T P ) / ( T P + F N )$ and captures the ability of the classifier to identify balling-susceptible alloy-process pairs. Accuracy is the fraction of correctly classified entries, mathematically defined as $A = ( T P +$ $T N ) / ( T P + T N + F P + F N )$ .

    "content": "It is known that AdaBoost predicts distorted class membership probabilities [132]; This is attributed to the fact that boosting can be considered as an additive logistic regression model [132]. As a result, a boosting-model will attempt to replicate a logit of the true probabilities instead of the true probabilities [132], meaning AdaBoost models are typically poorly calibrated. To predict the actual probabilities, the logit transformation must be inverted, which can be achieved via isotonic regression [132]. A calibration curve can be used to gauge the how well a model is calibrated [131]. In a calibration curve, the predicted probabilities are binned and plotted along the $x$ -axis while the normalized frequency of observation is plotted on the $y \\cdot$ -axis such that a perfectly calibrated model will have a calibration curve of the form $y = x ,$ , as shown in Fig. 3. The three classifiers were trained and calibrated with $7 5 \\%$ of the database. For each test fold, 4 folds are used to train the classifier and the remaining fold is used to calibrate the trained model. These 5 models are then ensembled and provide an averaged probabilistic prediction. The remaining $2 5 \\%$ of the database was considered a validation set and was used to generate the calibration curves in order to benchmark the calibrated models. Additional details about the training and testing data set can be found in the Supplementary Materials associated with this work. The calibration curves of the three classifiers are shown in Fig. 3. The Calibrated AdaBoost classifier is the best performing model after calibration.",

    "content": "As a final design exercise, the outputted probabilities of balling from the calibrated AdaBoost classifier were investigated within the Ti-AlV system, shown in Fig. 4. In general, within the Ti-Al-V ternary, the probability of balling increases for compositions with low $\\tau _ { s o l i d } / \\tau _ { s p r e a d }$ values (red region in Fig. 1a) as LED decreases, which makes intuitive sense: lower LED correspond to higher scan speeds (at a given power), which should increase the susceptibility to unstable melt pools. The calibration curve, Brier loss score, and log-loss score indicate acceptable performance by the classifier.",

    "content": "# 5. Summary and conclusions\nIf an alloy-AM processing parameter pair are not compatible, the resulting specimen will exhibit processing induced complications such as residual internal stresses, nonuniform melting and solidification, balling, etc. Two solutions exist to remedy these complications: tuning processing parameters for a particular AM technology to print conventional alloys, and/or develop novel alloys specifically for AM. The majority of research into AM has sought the former solution, overlooking the fact that the majority of engineering alloys were designed for manufacturing via processing routes other than AM. To realize the latter solution of designing alloys for AM-amenability, criteria for printability are needed to screen for intrinsically printable alloys. In this work we demonstrate a CALPHAD-based indicator, the ratio of the characteristic solidification time and spreading time, $\\tau _ { s o l i d } / \\tau _ { s p r e a d }$ , to screen for alloys of arbitrary composition, that are intrinsically resistant to balling, in a HTP manner. By visualizing the composition-dependence of the indicator in three exemplary ternary alloy systems, we have demonstrated its applicability to alloy design for AM. Furthermore, with an AM database, we demonstrated the ability of the proposed metric to predict if a proposed AM design will exhibit balling. A calibrated probabilistic classifier trained on $\\tau _ { s o l i d } / \\tau _ { s p r e a d }$ , LED, and dwell time yielded log-loss and Brierloss scores of 0.235 and 0.070, indicating these features are able to account for most of the conditions that lead to balling in an AM print. As the cost of prototyping novel metallic AM prints is prohibitively expensive, printability criteria, such as $\\tau _ { s o l i d } / \\tau _ { s p r e a d }$ , will aid researchers in searching vast composition spaces for intrinsically printable alloys.",

    "content": "This research discusses the comparative investigation of the Inconel-625 superalloy manufactured by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process and conventional process. The fabricated component was investigated to reveal the phase transformations, microstructural features and nano-hardness. Further, wear test was conducted on specimens manufactured by both the methods as above, to study the tribological properties. XRD analysis showed that the SLM specimen has more intensity at (111) difraction peak than the other two specimens and that the solid solution of $\\gamma$ -(Ni, Cr, Fe) (FCC) phases grew at (111), (2 0 0) and (220) planes. The Inconel-625 powder had lattice parameters $0 . 3 5 9 2 { \\mathrm { ~ n m } }$ , $0 . 3 1 1 6 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ and $0 . 3 0 1 2 { \\mathrm { n m } }$ , whereas the SLM specimen possessed the lattice parameters $0 . 3 5 9 9 { \\mathrm { n m } }$ , $0 . 3 1 2 1 \\mathrm { n m }$ and $0 . 3 0 1 2 \\mathrm { n m }$ which were higher than the other two specimens. The microstructure analysis confrmed the presence of consistent and homogeneously equiaxed cell in the conventional alloy, whereas the SLM specimen possessed heterogeneous columnar structure. Along with the columnar cell, some equiaxed and cellular cell were also formed in the SLM specimen due to remelting of the overlapped region. Moreover, the formation of equiaxed cell in XY, YZ and ZX plane directions of the conventional alloy specimen and columnar cell in the SLM specimen was confrmed through Electron backscatter difraction (EBSD) analysis. The SLM-produced specimen exhibited higher nano-hardness due to the formation of angular columnar cell, fne hard phases, efective bonding strength and defect-free surface. Abrasive wear mechanism played an important role in both the samples. The wear rate of the conventional Inconel-625 alloy specimen was around $4 . 5 8 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 } / \\mathrm { m }$ while it was $1 .",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is an advanced solid free form (SFF) technique and is highly utilized by many industries to develop fully functional metal components with complex geometry and high strength. The required 3D (3-Dimensional) model gets scanned and sliced by 2D (2-Dimensional) stacks into several layers, then the actual part is layered and consolidated by starting materials in either powder and wire form [1]. Adopting the AM process can reduce the processing time and it becomes easier to fabricate the near-net shape products. One such advanced technique in Direct Metal Laser Fabrication (DMLF), known as the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process, fuses the powders in a particular area from a powder bed. The conventional methods are subtractive, but the material addition process has a unique advantage of rapid manufacturing along with economical material usage [2]. SLM is a new methodology in processing additive ways that is signifcantly faster in layer-by-layer fabrication of high strength and geometrically complex hard-to-machine metal parts [3]. Laser energy is used to fuse the powder particles in the powder bed system that create the required solid component. The build orientation is directed in the z-axis and a new layer is formed over the previously solidifed layer; this process continues until the component is fnished [4]. Researchers are continuously putting hard efort in fnding the superior bulk densifed materials with good mechanical properties and this can bring out the potential of SLM in manufacturing diferent metal parts [5, 6].",

    "content": "Nickel-based superalloys are extensively used in various industrial engineering applications. The ever-increasing demand for superalloys, and particularly Inconel-based ${ \\mathrm { N i } } { \\mathrm { - C r } }$ for its preferential characteristics of high yield strength, tensile strength and creep resistance properties at high-temperature corrosion, is attractive in many felds such as aerospace, marine and oil industries. However, due to the high strength and hardness of Inconel-625 superalloy is being a challenging task using traditional methods [7]. Moreover, the nickel-based Inconel-625 alloy has the capability to withstand aggressive environments due to the solid solution strengthening of Mo and Nb elements [8, 9]. However, the nickel-based Inconel-625 superalloy is applied to various moving components typically subjected to several critical situations such as thermal stresses, fatigue loading and corrosion, and therefore experience higher mechanical energy losses due to wear and friction [10]. Hence, the control of wear and friction by the Inconel-625 superalloy is needed to extend the service life of moving mechanical components.",

Javidrad and Salemi [12] investigated the elastic constants of additively produced Inconel-625 superalloy through the ultrasonic technique. The proposed ultrasonic technique resulted in a good correlation in the determination of elastic constants of additively produced Inconel-625 superalloy. Inaekyan et al. [13] studied the microstructure, grain orientation and stress–strain behaviour of SLM-made Inconel-625 superalloy. Alena et al.

The result showed that the reinforced nano- $\\mathrm { T i B } _ { 2 }$ Inconel-625 improved the mechanical and tribological properties. From the above literature, it can be seen that many works have been carried out on the mechanical properties of the SLM-produced Inconel-625 superalloy. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no literature has been found on a comparison of the tribological study between the conventional Inconel-625 and SLM produced Inconel-625 superalloy. This study used the SLM process to fabricate Inconel-625 superalloy and compared its properties (phase evolution, microstructural features, nanohardness) with the conventionally produced Inconel-625 superalloy. Further, the tribological behaviour of the SLMproduced Inconel-625 and conventional Inconel-625 superalloy were studied, along with plausible wear mechanisms.",

    "content": "Phases related to Nb and Mo elements are not observed in this present XRD diagram (Fig. 3a) due to the small content of Nb and Mo elements. Moreover, there was no precipitation of MC carbide intermetallic phases in the SLM specimen. However, during the SLM process, a small content of Nb formed as $\\mathrm { N i } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { N b }$ orthorhombic phase and MC carbide elements based on the presence of Nb and Mo in EDS analysis on the SLM specimen (Fig. 6g and Table 4), which is analysed in Sect. 3.2. Moreover, the presence of a small amount of Nb and Mo in the $\\gamma$ -matrix led to an increase in the lattice distortion as the lattice constant reached a maximum. The reason behind the growth of these $\\mathrm { N i } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { N b }$ , Mo and MC carbide phases between crystals was that the Ni and $\\mathrm { C r }$ elements in the Inconel-625 powder started to solidify from liquid to $\\gamma$ phases at a beginning stage. This process continued until all high-temperature melting point elements solidifed. The melting points of Nb, C and Mo are $2 4 7 7 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , $3 3 5 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $2 6 2 3 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , respectively. However, the alloy's melting point of Nb, C and Mo are reduced due to the formation of the eutectic composition as the eutectic reaction of liquid to $\\gamma$ phases and MC carbide were occurred by consuming C elements. This reaction continued and enriched the inter-crystal region. However, the presence of these phases was very less as the cooling rate of solidifed region in the SLM process was around $1 0 5 ~ \\mathrm { K / s }$ which was extremely high compared to the conventional process [18]. As a result, the reconstruction velocity of Nb, C and Mo atoms was higher than the difusion velocity at the solid–liquid intersection region.",

Among the specimens, the SLM specimen was shifted to 45.32 angle, whereas the conventional specimen shifted to 45.45 from the Inconel-625 powder. From this data, it was found that the SLM specimen had a positive angle deviation from the powder and a negative angle deviation from the conventional alloy due to change in crystal lattice [10]. Moreover, the position of XRD peak is also sensitive to residual stress of materials [19]. It has been well known that the SLM-processed samples usually have excessive residual stress due to ultrafast heating and cooling rates during the process, which could have an efect on peak position of the XRD data [20].

Based on this analysis, it was found that the molten pool had surface tension during the melting of the diferent volumes of the Inconel-625 particles (Fig. 1). During this melting process, some part of the kinetic energy of the laser beam was transferred as the surface energy of the powder particles.

Moreover, the bottom layer acted as a heat sink region [24, 25], which resulted in the generation of columnar cell that was perpendicular to the bottom layer.

As a result, the originally formed columnar cell were broken and formed various directions of columnar cell (Fig. 5d).

From the elemental analysis, the conventional alloy has the element concentrations in higher fraction of $\\mathrm { w t } \\%$ , starting from Ni followed by Cr, C, Mo, Nb and Fe.

In the conventional alloy, there could be a possibility for oxidation between carbon and oxygen which can be eliminated in the SLM specimen by using nitrogen shroud gas atmospheric condition throughout the printing processing. Similarly, EDS analysis was performed on the three diferent structures of SLM specimen, namely columnar, equiaxial and cellular cells. The corresponding results are listed out in Table 4. In the equiaxial cell, Ni and Cr elements were more in weight fraction. This was because the solvent atoms of $\\mathrm { C r }$ were higher compared to other alloying elements that led to dilution in a solid solution of $\\gamma$ -Ni phases. At the cellular and columnar cell, the content of the Ni element was less compared to the equiaxial cell. In addition to that, the presence of Mo and Nb was signifcantly higher than that of the equiaxial cell. These higher (Mo, Nb) phases were usually formed at the rapid solidifcation process as the SLM process solidifed the layer very rapidly compared to other fabrication processes. Moreover, Mo and Nb elements have a tendency to segregate during the melting of the Inconel-625 powder while the SLM process was performed [26]. Mo and Nb elements moved continuously from the molten coagulation powder zone to the liquid region due to its difusion property. As a result, segregation of Mo and Nb elements occurred and increased its presence in the cellular and columnar cells region.",

Equiaxed and columnar cells were represented as circular and rectangular dotted lines in Fig. 7. Figure 7a shows the conventional alloy at XY direction which possessed larger size cells as well as equiaxed texture morphology. These cells had grown at random directions and the size of the cells were more or less of uniform nature. All of the cells in the conventional alloy specimen had equiaxed larger size cells. Larger elongation columnar cells are observed in Fig. 7b where the length of cells is around $2 0 { - } 2 5 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ . In Fig.  7b, the presence of each cell is represented by a unique colour. Throughout the image in Fig. 7b, similar columnar cell is found which confrms that the columnar texture dominated during the formation of the cells in the SLM specimen. The columnar cells had grown from the bottom region to the top region of the molten pool. The interaction of the laser and Inconel-625 powder, un-melted Inconel-625 powder, liquid molten metal and shroud gas collaboratively generated the steeper temperature gradient. This temperature gradient created Marangoni convection and surface tension. The convection fow velocity of the molten pool reached $1 0 \\mathrm { m / s }$ as per the results obtained from the simulation work in [27]. This convection heat transfer of the molten pool had broken the initial growth of the columnar cells. As a result, parts of columnar dendrites changed their direction of growth. Thus, the growth of the cells was seen in diferent directions and not in the same direction. Thus, the property of the material is mainly dependent on the formation of these textures. However, along with the columnar cell, some equiaxed cells, as well as the cellular cell, were found in the SLM specimen (Fig. 7b).",

    "content": "The enhancement of hardness of the SLM specimen was due to the microstructural modifcations and rapid heat dissipation during the phase changes which developed an efective bonding between the layers in the SLM technique. Moreover, in the SLM specimen, the alloying elements such as the Cr solute atom were well diluted in the solid solution of Ni solvent that led to an increase in the hardness of the SLM processed specimen. The involvement in the rapid heating and cooling rate of the SLM process produced the internal residual stress and twining, and this caused enhancement in hardness. Moreover, the decrease of the cell size due to a larger temperature gradient and increase in the lattice distortion values were also responsible for the increase of the nano-hardness value. The increase in the lattice parameter was due to the dissolution of Cr elements into the Ni matrix. Nano-hardness of the SLM specimen was comparable to the literature data that was produced by the EBM process due to larger temperature gradients in SLM than that of EBM as the powder bed was preheated to $1 0 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ in the EBM process [30]. Moreover, the columnar cells restricted the boundary movement due to dislocation, which resulted in the improvement of the hardness of the SLM specimen. In the SLM process, molten Inconel-625 powder was deposited layerby-layer and the specimen was fabricated from the bottom layer to the top layer. During this process, the Inconel-625 powder deposited as the newest layer was bonded with the previous layer through thermal conductivity. As a result, the new layer transferred heat energy to the previously solidifed layer which was repeated until a full specimen was fabricated. It led to form second phase crystal structures such as equiaxed and cellular cell. However, because of lack of time and transfer of heat energy during the SLM process, these second phase crystal structure formations were fewer.",

    "content": "The dry sliding wear test was performed on both the conventional Inconel-625 alloy and the SLM Inconel-625 specimens, and the values for wear rate and coefcient of friction (CoF) were obtained for the tested specimens. The results depended on various tribological process parameters such as applied load, sliding velocity, operating temperature, etc. [31]. The applied load $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { N }$ , sliding velocity $1 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m / s }$ and sliding distance $2 8 0 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ were selected as processing parameters for the present wear study. The wear rate and CoF of both the specimens are shown in Fig.  9. It was observed that the wear rate of the conventional Inconel-625 alloy specimen exhibited higher value compared with the SLM specimen as shown in Fig. 9a.

Initially, the wear rate for the conventional Inconel-625 alloy specimen was the same as the SLM specimen up to $4 0 \\mathrm { s }$ sliding rotation. However, the wear rate started to increase in the conventional Inconel-625 alloy specimens after $4 0 \\mathrm { s }$ sliding rotation. The SLM specimen is controlled by the wear rate and maintained as constant for the complete sliding distance of $2 8 0 0 \\mathrm { m }$ . The SLM-produced specimen showed higher hardness and a comparatively reduced wear rate compared to the conventional Inconel-625 alloy specimen. The higher wear rate of the conventional Inconel-625 alloy specimen is due to the reduced hardness. The columnar cells with smaller size and good bonding strength between the layers enhanced the wear resistance of the SLM specimen.",

    "content": "The CoF of the conventional Inconel-625 alloy and SLM Inconel-625 specimen are shown in Fig. 9b. The CoF of the conventional Inconel-625 alloy specimen is increased drastically to 0.45 and then gradually the slop of CoF was increased to $3 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { s }$ . In these regions, those contact areas started to progress into the self-mating stage which is produced in contact with the higher region between the pin and disc. Then, the CoF abruptly changed from 350 s to the end of the experiment due to the considerable friction generated between the pin and the disc. Hence, the frictional force was increased and accordingly, the CoF also was increased. The SLM produced specimen shows lesser CoF, approximately 0.2, compared with the conventional Inconel-625 alloy specimen. This reduced CoF was expected due to more hardness of the surface which is produced through the SLM process [32, 33]. The increased strength on the SLM surface was initiated the less contact on the counterpart. Moreover, the contact points had higher hardness and had more shear strength. Hence, it needed more energy to shear the surfaces of the SLM specimen [34]. In this situation, heat was produced due to the frictional force and while increasing the heat between the sliding surfaces, there is a possibility to form the oxide layer on the pin surface. These oxide layers reduced the friction further as well as minimized the wear rate in the SLM specimen [35].",

It can be observed that the conventional Inconel-625 alloy specimen was afected severely and it lost more material due to heavy wear on its surface. Abrasion, cracks, pits, delamination, discontinuous deep grooves and wear debris were found on it. In the conventional Inconel-625 alloy specimen, the worn-out surface had shown scattered deep grooves and furrows which clearly represented the occurrence of abrasive wear. The micro abrasion was considered by microstructural variations, strengthening phase distributions and amount of alloying elements fraction. The conventional Inconel-625 alloy specimen showed more micro abrasion while the SLM specimen had shown mild abrasion which is observed in Fig. 10a and b. Some small plate-like wear debris, micro pits and cracks were observed over the surface on the conventional Inconel-625 specimen which demonstrates the presence of deformation phenomenon and delamination wear on the worn-out surface. This delamination led to plastic distortion, crack initiation, propagation and further extended to layer-by-layer delamination [36]. It can be noted that deep wear tracks and more deformed areas were observed on the conventional Inconel-625 specimens compared to the SLM processed samples.

This was due to the improved stability of resisting friction under long sliding distances and high loads. The observed CoF for the SLM specimen was around 0.2 which got much reduced due to the efective solid solution strengthening efect of Nb and Mo in the nickel phase. The motion of hard materials such as nickel alloy against the hardened-steel was increasing the local temperature. During the dry sliding test, the higher hardness of the SLM specimen reduced the material removal by increasing the abrasion resistance which would prevent the contact surface wear. In addition, the indication of cracks and delamination were obtained due to the plowing efect. Further, the EDS analysis results (Table 5) of the SLM worn-out specimen showed higher oxide formation $( 7 . 3 9 \\% )$ compared with the conventional Inconel-625 $( 1 . 8 6 \\% )$ worn-out specimen.

The wear rate of the specimens is dependent on the ability to resist the slippage of material. During the wear test, the material deformation occurred due to nucleation of dislocation on the slip plane. The dislocation and plastic deformation increased as the motion of the specimen moved continuously on the disc surface under particular load conditions. In the present study, $5 0 \\mathrm { N }$ load was applied on the specimen against the disc surface while the specimen was rotating on the disc surface. The normal force of $5 0 \\mathrm { N }$ was acting in the negative direction of $\\mathbf { Z }$ , while the friction force was acting at the x and y directions, which is represented in Fig. 11. Slippage of the plane has occurred when the shear force exceeded the maximum wear resistance of the material which is dependent on the orientation of grain growth as well as grain size. A larger grain size of equiaxed Inconel-625 (Fig. 11a) would easily slip compared to smaller grain. Similarly, larger size uniform equiaxed grain structure and columnar grains arrangement (Fig. 11b) in the same direction are prone to large slippage compared to columnar grains arrangement at an angle which had exposed less shear force than the conventional equiaxed Inconel-625 specimen. Moreover, columnar grains arrangement at an angle had resisted the slip of the plane as the SLM Inconel-625 specimen possessed an inclined columnar grain structure.",

    "content": "Studied the wear behaviour of $3 1 6 \\mathrm { L }$ stainless steel based on grain orientation [37]. It was found that the orientation of grains infuenced the generation of shear force which would act on the slip plane and concluded that the grains oriented at a steeper angle faced more shear force than those arranged at a moderate angle. In addition, the columnar dendrite structure easily adapted to the stain changes during the dry sliding wear test when compared to the equiaxed structure. The columnar dendrite structure coped up with the shear force which was induced during the wear test, whereas the equiaxed structure peeled of from the surface due to more shear force acting on it. It led to the removal of more material from the conventional alloyed surface in the form of abrasive groove, micro crater and pits, as the conventional alloyed specimen had a large size equiaxed structure (Fig. 10a). On the other hand, the columnar structure also peeled of; but the process took place gradually when the shear force acted on the columnar structure, and the peeling of was less compared to the conventional alloy at the same load condition due to angular orientation of the columnar structure and fne grain structure. Moreover, the SLM Inconel-625 specimen had some equiaxed structure and grains in random direction due to dissipation of heat fow during the SLM process based on material evaporation, gas expansion [38] and Marangoni fow [39]. As a result, some micro cracks and crates were observed on the SLM specimen, as it had a major quantity of columnar structure. As a result, the conventional alloy surface had a large quantity of the loss of equiaxed structure that led to increased surface roughness. On the contrary, a smooth worn-out surface was formed on the SLM specimen.",

The conventional Inconel-625 specimen showed a higher roughness average compared with the SLM worn-out specimen. The worn-out 3D topography of the conventional Inconel-625 specimen (Fig. 12a) shows higher valleys and peaks because of reduced hardness and higher material loss. As an outcome, the conventional Inconel-625 surface was damaged severely and formed the rough surface (Fig.  12b) with higher roughness. Therefore, the surface topography was afected heavily because of higher frictional force between the sliding surface, which leads to minimizing the service life of the component. However, the worn-out surface of the SLM specimen showed lesser variations in the valleys and peaks (Fig. 12c) due to the minimized wear rate.

    "content": "Laser-based powder bed fusion is becoming an increasingly competitive manufacturing technique.A high energy laser beam is applied to selectively melt powder particles within a powder bed.The molten particles coalesce to form a melt pool that subsequently fuses and consolidates with the previous layer of material.With an appropriate selection of process parameters a successive layer-by-layer buildup allows for the fabrication of dense parts with high design flexibility, for instance,by enabling complex part production down to the micro scale and tailored material properties.Powder bed fusionis applied to a variety of materials such as alloys [1,2],ceramics [3] and polymers [4] and is also utilized in the development of new material composites [5,6].Hence,laser-based powder bed fusion is a promising addition to established formative and substractive manufacturing approaches.\n\nThe fundamental building unit in laser-based powder bed fusion is the single melt track since each manufactured layer is composed of consecutive single tracks.Manufacturing defects of final parts often originate from melt-flow instabilities during single track formation. It is important to understand the defect generation in single track melt pools and their dependence on process parameters.Much effort has been dedicated to identify process maps that lead to stable single melt tracks [7-9],where a known process map constraint is due to melt pool balling.",

Large-size balling can cause a non-uniform powder distribution in the consecutive powder layer, poor wettability of the previous layer [2,3],pore formation [14],and even an interruption of the build process due to a collision with the paving roller [14]. Final parts show a rough surface morphology [14], higher porosity [15] or poor inter layer bonding [17] around balls.",

    "content": "Several factors are identified to affect balling in single track melt pools.In general, balling occurs due to a minimization of the surface free energy by capillary forces.The overall intensity of capillary forces depends on melt temperature as,for many materials,surface tension decreases with increasing temperature. Consequently,Marangoni flow induced by high temperature gradients at the melt pool surface contributes to the breakup of continuous tracks [18]. Balling is further driven by poor wettability between the liquid metal and its surrounding powder particles and substrate [12,16,17,19]. Insuficient remelting of the previous layer is particularly problematic when oxide layers are formed on the substrate, as they increase the wetting angles between the liquid and solid material [2O]. Sufficient remelting therefore is important to destroy such oxide layers [21] as well. Additionally,oxidation can invert surface tension gradients leading to surface flows directed towards the melt pool center and thus support melt aggregation [6].At low power density settings balling can occur in the form of melt island-aggregates.Insufficient heating leads to partially melted particles，unmelted substrate beneath the powder, and a melt pool that tends to cluster rather than wet the surface [22,23].Low melt temperatures and thus high melt viscosity and surface tension further enhance the process [1,5,14]. A commonly suggested solution to avoid such events is to increase the energy input [1] or reduce the powder layer thickness [9].At high scan velocities, the melt pool width and thus the weted substrate area decreases [24]. Long and narrow melt pools are prone to the Plateau-Rayleigh instability [2,3,7,10,13,15-18,24-26]. Poor melt pool spreading and shallow melt pool penetration further enhance the pool instability and breakup [7,12,14].",

    "content": " Analytical stability models [7,11,21,27] are used as breakup conditions for continuous single melt tracks [12,28-3O],yet their ability to predict the onset of balling is still in question [31].As the melt-pool-length-to-diameter ratio increases with increasing laser scan velocity,the melt pool is particularly susceptible to Plateau-Rayleigh instabilities in the process window of high scan speed and high laser power [24]. Ball formation also is found at low scan speeds and high energy input. High energy content within the melt pool reduces the rate of solidification.Hence,the time scale at which surface tension affects pool breakup increases as well [3O]. This type of balling at large liquid formation is referred to as 'self balling'[16,32].Ball formation itself is identified as a competitive non-equilibrium process between melt spreading and solidification [8,33,34]. Final droplet shapes depend on the complex interplay of capillary forces,inertia,solidification,thermal properties and heat content [33].While balling is avoided when the melt can spread out before it solidifies,quick cooling rates lead to premature termination of spreading and enhance balling [8].\n\nExtensive research is required to better understand the multitude of simultaneous mechanisms and to identify and enhance process maps for stable production.Process complexity in combination with temporal and spatial scales at the micro level make experimental in-situ measurements infeasible.Hence,increasing attention is devoted to numerical investigations [3,9,16,17,22,25,35-37].An adequate representation of selective laser melting at the powder scale,however,requires comprehensive numerical modeling.Its multi-phase nature in combination with phase transitions and complex interface topologies with strong deformations pose severe challenges to the underlying algorithms.",

    "content": "Yet, several numerical studies are able to reproduce the balling phenomenon and allow for an in-depth analysis of the melt-pool breakup process.Ren et al.[22] apply the finite volume method in combination with a volume-of-fluid interface algorithm and ray-tracing laser model to study the absorptive behavior and flow kinetics of a copper alloy. Their single melt track study shows intense absorptivity oscillations, which are ascribed to balling and result in increased exposure of substrate rather than melt to the laser beam.Adiscrete element method including viscous coalescence and densification models has been used for the study of balling phenomena of a nickel alloy by Boutaous et al.[35].Large variations of melt track widths indicate the presence of balling.From a sensitivity study on surface tension and viscosity they conclude that neither of the two have a significant influence on balling as coalescence of the melt is too fast. Li et al.[17] apply a phase-field method to 2D simulations of single melt tracks for pure nickel powder on stainless steel substrate.Their study of various wetting conditions between melt and substrate reveals a decreasing frequency of melt pool breakup for low wetting angles.Single melt track simulations of 316L stainless steel show discontinuous tracks and melt agglomeration at partially melted powder particles [36].The finite volume method algorithm by Gu et al.[37] is coupled with the volume of fluid interface model to study melt pool behavior in multi-layer scenarios.They show that the melt track of the first layer is discontinuous and exhibits melt agglomerates.A subsequent second layer leads to further clustering of melt and lack of fusion between the two layers.While at an increased power density a wavy but continuous first melt track is formed,in the second layer balling still occurs.It is concluded that the surface morphology of the first layer contributes to balling of consecutive layers.",

    "content": "In this work smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is applied [39].In contrast to finite volume or finite element methods it implicitly tracks the interface without requiring computationally demanding interface location and tracking algorithms making it particularly suitable for simulations that involve complex interfaces movements.SPH particles convect with the flow field eliminating the need for complex re-meshing or moving meshes.The method also is highly adaptable for simulating complex powder bed structures and fluid-solid boundaries, as different particles can be used for different materials.Additionally, the SPH method is stable for strong interface deformations,which makes it an ideal choice for simulating dynamic melt-pools and the balling process.For the accurate prediction of melt pool morphology and balling a WCsPH multi-phase model [4O] is employed,extended by transport-velocity [41] and consistent boundary conditions [42]. For an accurate representation of melt pool dynamics,pressure,viscous, and gravity forces are taken into account. Evaporation effects on the melt are considered by a recoil-pressure model [43].To account for the driving forces of balling,both capillary and Marangoni forces as well as wetting conditions are incorporated at the melt surface following [44]. A wetting angle of 7O degrees is chosen based on experimental contact angles measurements [8,45] and the cross section morphology in [38]. A precise representation of the energy balance is achieved by modeling thermal conduction in melt,powder and substrate [46],convective cooling byan ambient gas,evaporative cooling,a laser heat source,and solid-liquid phase change,considering the latent heat of melting and solidification.Material models from literature are applied to account for the temperature dependence of viscosity,surface tension,thermal conductivity,heat capacity and laser absorptivity,see A.3.",

    "content": "No ambient gas flow is induced and the surrounding gas is treated as isothermal to represent convective cooling.Thermal expansion within the melt pool and possibly resulting buoyancy forces are ignored. Thermal radiation and viscous heating are discarded.The applied absorptivity model accounts for the incidence angle,the dependence on temperature and an energy input at the material surface.As it does not consider multi-reflections within the vapor cavity,absorptivity is increased to match the target melt pool dimensions.While recoil pressure and evaporative cooling are included, mass loss due to evaporation is neglected.To account for increased viscosity of the melt in the mushy zone and to stabilize the simulations the dynamic viscosity is increased by a factor of ten, following [47,48]. The powder layer is explicitly resolved, yet powder particle motion is not incorporated at this stage.\n\nThe conservation laws of mass,momentum and energy govern the fluid mechanics and energy balance of balling.For incompressible fluids, the set of equations in Lagrangian form is\n\n$$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\frac { d \\rho } { d t } = - \\rho \\mathrm { { \\nabla } } \\cdot \\mathbf { v } , } \\\\ & { \\frac { d \\mathbf { v } } { d t } = \\mathbf { F } ^ { p } + \\mathbf { F } ^ { \\nu } + \\mathbf { F } ^ { \\sigma } + \\mathbf { F } ^ { e v } + \\mathbf { F } ^ { g } , } \\\\ & { \\frac { d h } { d t } = Q ^ { \\lambda } + Q ^ { e v } + Q ^ { l } , } \\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho , \\textbf { v }$ and $h$ are density,velocity，and enthalpy,respectively.

Case $\\# 3$ is shown at the time step where the laser is turned off while cases $\\# 2$ $\\# 5$ and $\\# 6$ are shown at the last time steps before the melt pool separation.In all four cases we find melt aggregation and a disturbed track topology in the region of initial melt pool development.At the onset of a single melt track the pool is more likely to accumulate,as shown in [1,25],even when there is no powder bed present [36].We believe this enhanced accumulation facilitates baling. Therefore,we disregard initial humps and focus the validation on the subsequent melt track.The topologies of cases $\\# 2$ and $\\# 5$ remain homogeneous for the most part and only a marginal amount of melt separates in case $\\# 2$ ,see Fig.3 (a) and (b).In contrast,large melt agglomerates separate from the main pool in cases $\\# 3$ and $\\# 6$ ,see Fig.3 (c) and (d).The developing balls extend over the powder layer height.Thus,the increased likelihood of balling for cases $\\# 3$ and $\\# 6$ as found in the experiments is confirmed by the simulations.

    "content": "The simulations allow for a precise determination of melt pool ratios and to quantify forces relevant for the cause and development of balling.In Fig.4 and Fig.5 the melt pool evolution for cases $\\# 3$ and $\\# 6$ are shown in top view and as centered cut section,respectively.We distinguish four regions of the melt pool: (I) depression, (II) transition,(II) neck,and (IV) tail end. In direct proximity of the laser beam strong recoil pressure and Marangoni forces induce a depression of the melt pool. Further downstream the transition region follows,characterized by decay of the high temperature gradients,the absence of prominent melt extrusion and a constant melt pool width. The section with contracting melt pool post laser-exposure is called the neck-region.The following tail end region eventually forms the isolated ball. Both the depression and transition region appear quasisteady while the neck and tail region vary periodically to form the emerging balls.The depression constitutes the deepest penetration into the substrate.It is followed by a gradual decrease of melt pool depth in the transition region. The contraction of melt at the tail end leads to a hemispherical shape which exceeds the powder layer height. In contrast, layer build-up in the neck region is marginal.As a result, the solidified track topology consists of a ball followed by a cavity. Note,while the melt pool size of case $\\# 6$ exceeds the one of case $\\# 3$ the ball size is smaller in case $\\# 6$ .The ball size depends on the onset of necking. In case $\\# 3$ necking starts further upstream, leading to a larger tail region and eventually a larger ball.

    "content": "Melt pool breakup shown in Fig.4and Fig.5 exhibits characteristics of Plateau-Rayleigh instability.A common parameter to evaluate this instability in melt pools is the length to width ratio [7,21].The length to width threshold ratios found in literature range between 2 and $\\pi$ [13].A clear indication as to which analytical model is most precise still is missing and their overall applicability is questioned [31].On the one hand,for process conditions of low melt penetration numerical studies from literature show melt breakup prior to the predicted ratios [lO].On the other hand, the stabilizing effect of melt penetration into the substrate is discarded completely in the analytical models suggesting an underestimation of the breakup ratios [7]. The resulting length to width ratios for cases $\\# 3$ and $\\# 6$ are 11.3 and 11.4,respectively.While these ratios agree with the available models they cannot confirm their accuracy as they are well beyond the model thresholds. Large length to width ratios for cases $\\# 2$ and $\\# 5$ indicate stable melt tracks beyond the analytical model predictions.This discrepancy most likely originates from the stabilization due to a considerate melt penetration which is discarded in the analytical models.Nonetheless, the present simulation results confirm the trend of long,shallow and narrow melt pools to be less stable.",

    "content": "Now,we take a closer look at the influence of Marangoni and capillary forces on the necking and breakup behavior.In this work,a linear surface-tension dependence on temperature is incorporated,see $\\sigma$ in A.3.Its impact on the melt pool is twofold.First, the capillary forces normal to the interfaces reduce with temperature.And more importantly, tangential Marangoni forces occur as a result of non-zero surface tension gradients along the interface.In Fig.6 (b) and (c),case $\\# 3$ is shown shortly after the onset of necking at time $1 9 6 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { s } ,$ as well as shortly before the pinch-off at time $2 1 6 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s }$ .The melt pool is color coded with the temperature. The lines $\\textcircled{1} . \\textcircled{4}$ and $\\textcircled{1 }$ correspond to the transverse surface tension plots in Fig.6 (a). In Fig. 6 (d) the surface tension along lines $\\textcircled{4}$ and $\\textcircled{8}$ is shown. The highest heat content and surface-tension gradients are found in the depression region.Downstream,high temperatures at the melt pool center lead to a low surface-tension that rapidly increases towards the cooler melt pool edges.In the transition region the surface tension at the melt pool sides remains constant while it increases along the center.As the Marangoni force results from the surface-tension gradient, their intensity can be estimated from the slope of the surface tension plots.It is concluded that a strong Marangoni force only is present in the depression region and quickly decreases in the transition region.Since surface-tension gradients decay over time,the Marangoni force attenuates as well. Shortly before ball pinch-off,only a weak Marangoni force acts in the neck region. Consequently,the Marangoni force,which promotes melt spreading, decays as necking progresses.",

    "content": "The melt pool breakup is followed by a melt contraction towards a ball.One common explanation of the balling process is the competing mechanisms of solidification and spreading [8,33,34]. From the assumption of no impact speed of the melted material it is concluded that melt flow is mainly driven by capillary forces and inertia.A comparison of the time scale of super-heat removal to the spreading time is then used to predict the presence or absence of balling. Faster solidification than spreading timescales are claimed to lead to a premature stop of spreading and thus induce balling.In accordance to [33],the solidification time in the present study is approximated by $\\tau ^ { s o l } = 2 \\left( w ^ { 2 } / 3 \\alpha \\right) \\ln \\left( T _ { 0 } - T _ { \\infty } \\right) / \\left( T _ { s } - T _ { \\infty } \\right)$ For cases $\\# 3$ and $\\# 6$ follow solidification times of $5 1 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s }$ and $4 2 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { s } }$ .Here,melt track widths of $w =$ $1 1 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ and $w = 1 2 7 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } } ;$ ，thermal diffusivities of $\\alpha = 6 . 7 8 e ^ { - 6 } ~ \\mathrm { { m } } ^ { 2 } / \\mathrm { { s } }$ and $\\alpha = 7 . 4 3 e ^ { - 6 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \\mathrm { s }$ ，super heat temperatures $T _ { 0 } = 1 5 7 9 \\mathrm { K }$ and $T _ { 0 } = 1 5 6 3 \\mathrm { K } ,$ an ambient temperature of ${ { T } _ { \\infty } } \\mathrm { ~ = ~ } 3 5 3 \\mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ and solidus temperature of\n\n![](images/169ef9631b8d19e4f0092a98bda0eee6bc96ac47c0a303aba6deacf29d2bb654.jpg)  \nFig.7.Longitudinal center cross section in neck region between $x = 1 8 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ and $x = 2 1 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ (a) pressure contour plot at time $t = 1 9 6 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s }$ $t = 2 0 8 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s }$ and $t = 2 1 4 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s } ,$ (b) normalized pressure distribution through neck and (c) specific momentum in upstream and downstream neck region over time.",

It is interesting to note,that in contrast to the model assumption of zero impact speed, the melt has considerable non-zero momentum after pinch-off,see Fig.7(c).In Figs.8 and 9 the tail end region of cases $\\# 3$ and $\\# 6$ and their respective solidification fronts are shown shortly after the melt pool breakup.The melt pool is color coded by temperature.In both cases we find a contracting melt pool rather than a flow dominated by spreading forces.In case $\\# 3$ the melt contracts from time $t = 2 1 8 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s }$ to time $t = 2 2 0 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s }$ at which point the solidification front is caught up.The same behavior is found in case $\\# 6$ where melt contraction and solidification define the balling process.We conclude that, when balling occurs following a necking process,the assumption of zero impact speed of the model by [33] no longer is valid. Instead,the balling process is best characterized by an advancing solidification front at the rear of the tail region and melt contraction followed by an advancing solidification at the front of the tail region.",

In addition,the model capability to predict parameter sets for balling and non-balling melt tracks is validated for two power settings.We identify clearly absence and presence of balls as well as rough and smooth melt pool topologies at the respective conditions.\n\nAn investigation of the surface-tension distribution in transversal and longitudinal scan direction reveals the connection of Marangoni forces to the melt pool dynamics.Particular important to the balling process is the decay of surface tension gradients in the necking region during the melt contraction.It indicates a related decay of stabilizing melt flow towards the pool edges.",

    "content": "In contrast,capillary forces within the neck increase as necking progresses both due to an increase of curvature and a reduction in temperature.A resulting high capillary pressure induces a convective melt flux away from the neck region,ultimately leading to the pinchoff of the tail region.As a result,material build-up within the neck area is marginal.Analytical estimates for breakup conditions cannot be confirmed by the numerical results as the melt pool shows to be stable well beyond the model thresholds.This deviation can be explained by stabilizing melt pool penetration into the substrate,which is disregarded by the analytical estimates.We find a comparable breakup behavior for both investigated power settings.The ball size shows to depend more on the necking onset rather than the size of the melt pool itself.\n\nThe balling process is best characterized by an advancing solidification front at the rear,and an initial melt contraction at the front that is followed by an advancing melt front at a later stage.Thus,from the simulations the common explanation of the competing mechanisms of spreading and solidification cannot be confirmed.Instead,we find that capillary forces in the neck region induce a melt contraction which is stronger than melt spreading.",

Strategies for using LR to reduce total porosity,near-surface porosity,and improving surface roughness are briefly discussed.",

    "content": "However,several potential defects still inherently exist that cannot be mitigated by changing processing parameters.External and internal defects such as surface roughness and porosity could be detrimental to fatigue life [1] and hardness [2] of the as-built samples.Studies have shown to successfully mitigate the external defects on bulk structures via mechanical finishing processes (machining [3],burnishing [4],shot peening [5],and ultrasonic cavitation abrasive finishing [6]),chemical finishing process [7],and electrochemical finishing process [8].Mechanical processes,however,are challenging to implement for thin wall geometries due to deflection,and chemical/electrochemical processes are not suitable for repair manufacturing application where the parent material could not undergo such process.Internal defects in bulk materials are decreased through hot isostatic pressing (HIP)[9,lO] and shot peening [11],and these methods have shown to improve component density through pore closure.AHIP treatment,however,is limited in that it only effectively closes internal pores and is also a separate process not integrable within AM equipment. Shot peening may offer some opportunity for surface pore closure but would be relatively challenging to implement in between layers to mitigate internal pores.",

    "content": "In contrast to these approaches,laser polishing or laser remelting (LR) can address these drawbacks.LR has been shown to improve external [12-16] and internal AMdefects [17-2O] by melting the peaks and filling the valleys of the surface,and by closing pores and holes. Prior works have investigated the impact of LR on porosity and mechanical properties through experiments and simulations.Xin et al. [17] investigated the effect of LR scan speed on microstructural evolutions and Laves phase which affects material hardness. The LR process refined Laves phase and porosity improving average hardness slightly in IN718.Wei et al.[18] showed significant decrease in residual stress, formation of strong textures,increased elongation,and no improvements in tensile strength by LR.Chen et al.[19] explored the effect of LR on redistribution of Si element on the surface improving hardness,and wear resistance.Yasa et al.[2O] showed improvement in part density, surface roughness,and microstructure of selective laser melting (SLM) parts.Zhao and Cong [21,22] showed improved fatigue crack propagation and thermal fatigue resistance after LR processing. These works have demonstrated the effect of LR processing on microstructural evolution,part density,and various mechanical properties.Recent studies have shown capability to effectively decrease internal and external defects by LR processing,however most of these studies have focused on larger-scale bulk depositions.In contrast, there remains limited understanding regarding defect mitigation by LR processing in thin-walled depositions where substrate-related geometry may influence process effectiveness.This is especially applicable for aerospace components such as compressors and turbine blades where thin-walled geometric features are prevalent.\n\nTable 1 Experimental parameter sets.

The determined surface by using the ISO5O method can be used to accurately measure dimension of the object when the data was assumed to be free from artifacts [25].XCT scans were taken to minimize X-ray artifacts such as scattering artifacts,star artifacts,and beam hardening artifacts. Internal porosity was also evaluated using VolumeGraphics,and measurements were made of each pore's location,diameter,volume,and sphericity.Fig.2C shows a deposit made transparent and with internal porosity shaded according to diameter.",

    "content": "# 4.1． Geometry analysis\nGenerally,a higher energy density corresponds with a larger melt pool area and hence larger deposits on thick and wide substrates [27,28].It was initially hypothesized that a wider substrate would result in larger deposits because of the increased area for powder catchment around the laser source.Further,with the $1 . 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ laser spot size,it was initially presumed that any deposit on a less than $\\mathbf { w } = 1 . 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ substrate would have had smaller deposits because of the size of the melt pool. However,it was observed in the present study that the same deposition energy density on narrower substrates resulted in larger deposits.In this case, the radius of deposit on the narrower substrate was $4 6 ~ \\%$ greater than that on the wide substrate even without LR.This could be due to a number of reasons.First,the impact of the energy absorbed by the substrate may be more significant in the narrower substrate which may lead to a larger melt pool or increase the remelt area.In this case, the energy absorbed by the narrower substrates likely could not be dissipated quickly enough [24].The effect of LR on deposit radius diminished for wider substrates due to a faster cooling rate from larger substrate mass acting as a heat sink.In other works,the use of similar energy density on substrates with smaller cross-sectional areas led to inconsistent bead geometry causing bulging and wavy tracks [29,30]. These inconsistent geometries were linked to uneven temperature distribution causing different density and surface tension between the molten pool and rapidly solidifying track [30].",

    "content": "The XCT scans revealed evolution of the spatial distribution of porosity with the LR process.In the powder-blown directed energy deposition process,the substrate is melted along with the feed powder in the melt pool,followed by solidification.In this process,the lower region of the melt pool would contain larger portions of melted substrate, whereas the upper regions would mostly consist of melted powders that contain internal pores by gas trapping in production [31,32]. From the present results,this statement is supported by showing the majority of pore counts $( 6 5 - 7 5 \\% )$ and pore volume $( 6 1 - 7 4 \\%$ existing in the upper half of the as-deposited samples regardless of the substrate widths.

    "content": "We hypothesize that porosity formation is closely related to the size of the melt pool for the given condition.With a larger melt pool at $\\mathbf { w } =$ $0 . 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ ,more metal powder is captured,but the input energy per melt pool volume may not be enough to melt the powder completely.Preexisted pores in the powder,unmelted particles,or voids between particles could all be submerged into the melt pool and entrapped due to less absorbed energy density per melt pool volume [33].Having larger melt pool could also increase the chance of entrapping argon gas from shielding/carrier gas flow [34].Itis proposed that pore density formed ina single-track deposit is positively correlated to the diameter of the melt pool. With the LR process,the competition among pore velocity, the Marangoni-driven flow,and solidification rate determines formation and reduction of pore count and volume.In the upper regions of the deposits,higher ELR resulted in lesser number and volume of pores $( \\mathrm { { N } } _ { \\mathrm { { v } } , + }$ and $\\mathrm { \\bf p } _ { \\mathrm { v } + } )$ . This was because the upper region experienced higher energy by being closer to the applied energy,this giving enough time for the pores to escape or close before the melt pool solidified.In the lower regions of the deposits,however, the substrate width had effects on resulting porosity.At substrate width of $\\mathbf { w } = 0 . 5 \\ : \\mathrm { m m }$ ,deposits showed decrease in $\\mathrm { N } _ { \\mathrm { v } \\mathrm { - } }$ and $\\mathrm { P } _ { \\mathrm { v } \\mathrm { - } }$ with LR,however,deposits showed the increased $\\mathrm { N } _ { \\mathrm { v } \\mathrm { - } }$ and $\\mathrm { P } _ { \\mathrm { v } \\mathrm { - } }$ at $\\mathbf { w } = \\{ 1 . 0 , 2 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\}$ .As for the wider substrates,the lower half of the bead had a cooling rate of an order of magnitude higher than that of narrower substrates.",

The present investigation focuses on understanding the effect of laser power and scan speed on the evolution of melt pool, porosity and multiple thermal cycling effects on the microstructure in parts fabricated using selective laser melting. In this study, Ti- 6Al- 4V pre- alloyed powder was used to produce single- track deposits and bulk parts. Using different combinations of laser power and scan speeds, single- track deposits and bulk parts were produced. The cross- sections of the single- track deposits and bulk samples were prepared for metallographic observations and the melt pool shape and size and porosity were evaluated. When a low energy density was applied the un- melted powder particles produced irregularly shaped porosity, and a high energy density resulted in rounded porosity, which was due to keyhole effects. The samples produced with a proper combination of power and speeds were fully dense. Further, microstructural development under the influence of process condition was highlighted. Overall, the study demonstrates a good correlation between the single- track melt pool geometries, porosity in bulk parts and also demonstrates the microstructural inhomogeneity during deposition.\n\nKeywords Additive manufacturing · Selective laser melting · Ti- 6Al- 4V alloy · Single- track deposits",

    "content": "Additive manufacturing belongs to the group of manufacturing technologies where 3D parts are fabricated by material addition in a layer- by- layer fashion, usually from a computer- aided design model [1]. Additive manufacturing technologies offer enhanced design capabilities for geometric freedom that allows producing parts which are otherwise not possible to fabricate with traditional manufacturing processes. There are various additive manufacturing processes such as selective laser melting, direct laser deposition, electron beam melting, wire- feed additive manufacturing, shape deposition modeling, ultrasonic consolidation, binder jetting, and friction freeform fabrication for producing metallic components [1- 8]. Titanium alloys are used in several structural applications due to their lower density, high strength to weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and elevated temperature properties [9]. Traditionally, titanium alloys are made by vacuum induction re- melting and carefully controlled thermo- mechanical processing to tune the microstructure that will demonstrate satisfactory mechanical properties. Although manufacturing methods are well established for titanium alloys, the high production cost limits the use of these alloys. Additive manufacturing could provide a means to fabricate parts in titanium alloys at a lower cost. Among the various grades of titanium alloys, Ti- 6Al- 4V ( $\\alpha + \\beta$  alloy) is the most popular and finds its applications in aerospace, automotive, biomedical, defence and industrial sectors [9, 10]. The alloy has good weldability characteristics, making it amenable for SLM.",

    "content": "Of the commercially available additive manufacturing technologies, selective laser melting (SLM) is one of the most popular and successful powder- bed fusion based additive manufacturing processes. In SLM, consolidation of metal powder is achieved by melting and solidifying a small volume of material in a track- by- track and layer- by- layer fashion using a high- intensity laser. In other words, the laser beam scans over a layer of powder in a straight line and melts the powder particles under the beam and creates a small molten pool of metal. As the laser beam traverses, it leaves a thin track of solidified metal behind. On repeating the single track deposit with a well- defined overlap (hatch spacing), a layer of cross- section is produced. Upon repeating this layer- by- layer deposition, an entire part is constructed [1]. A simple schematic of the SLM process showing track- by- track and layer- by- layer deposition is presented in Fig. 1 [11]. SLM is controlled by various processing parameters such as laser power  $(P)$ , scanning speed  $(v)$ , layer thickness  $(t)$  and hatch spacing  $(h)$ . These parameters define energy density of the process as [12]:\n\n$$\nE = \\frac{P}{\\nu\\times h\\times t}. \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nAlthough energy density is a measure of the energy input to the process, there are other factors such as the composition of the metal, atmosphere used, scan pattern, and powder- bed temperature, which also play a significant role [13]. All the parameters mentioned above mutually influence each other, but the degree of effect by each parameter is not well understood. Therefore, studying the basic element of SLM, i.e., the single- track deposits, will provide a deeper understanding of the process and could assist in identifying a process window for optimizing parameters, particularly when dealing with new alloy systems [11].",

    "content": "In recent times, a great deal of work has been carried out on the Ti- 6Al- 4V alloy for optimization of parameters, microstructural characterization, and mechanical property evaluation using SLM [12- 15]. Gong et al. [11] reported a strategic method to arrive at optimum parameters through producing single beads on the base plate and extended their work to characterize a test pad  $(10\\mathrm{mm}\\times 10\\mathrm{mm}\\times 1\\mathrm{mm})$  with multiple layers. Gong et al. described the effect of power and scan speed on the melt- pool geometry, and also showed surface topology of multi- layer pads, which were evaluated for porosity and quality evaluation. However, a detailed study on porosity and microstructures was not reported. Also, in their study, the single- track deposits were made on a base plate made on a Ti plate. Very recently, Yang et al. [16] investigated the role of melt pool on microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti- Al- 4V. The study explores the use of a keyhole mode over a conduction mode for SLM deposits, and it was noticed that the conduction mode provided denser parts with better mechanical properties. In their experiments, the single- track deposits were made on a pure Ti plate. In both the case studies, single- track deposits resulted in a significant amount of dilution with the base plate alloy. It is well known that dilution contributes to a change in the local composition of the melt pool, thus changing the melting temperature of the Ti- 6Al- 4V alloy powder in the local single- track vicinity. In other words, the volume of the melt pool created will be different from the actual volume when the melting temperature is changed. Hence, the estimate of melt pool size will probably be close to the actual one but not a true representation of the melt pool size. Therefore, a study on single tracks made of the same alloy (Ti- 6Al- 4V plate) is necessary to have an accurate measure of melt pool geometry. Thijis et al.",

    "content": "When a thin wall equivalent to the beam diameter is made, the laser will scan as one single line, and thus make a single line of deposit. It is known that support structures in an EOS system have a minimum smallest dimension of  $100~\\mu \\mathrm{m}$  [18]. Therefore, single- track deposits can be produced utilizing line support structure settings. To achieve a single line deposit, thin wall sections with the dimension of  $0.1\\mathrm{mm}\\times 0.1\\mathrm{mm}\\times 100\\mathrm{mm}$  were made using Materialise Magics software and placed at a height of  $5\\mathrm{mm}$ . Then support structures were generated under these thin wall sections/parts. It is to be noted that these thin walls are sacrificial parts and will be deleted once supports are generated. Then parameters (listed in Table 1) with various laser powers and scan speeds were applied to each of the single line supports. A Ti- 6Al- 4V alloy plate of  $3.3\\mathrm{mm}$  was placed on the build platform, and then a layer of  $30\\mu \\mathrm{m}$  thick powder was spread. A single exposure laser scan was applied to scan one single layer. In this method, single track deposits on a Ti- 6Al- 4V alloy plate (thickness  $3.3\\mathrm{mm}$ ) were made.

    "content": "The top surface of the single line deposits was observed under SEM, and the results are presented in Fig. 4. The single- track deposit scanned with low laser power, and slow scan speed (50 W and  $500~\\mathrm{mm / s}$ ) shows a continuous, and a uniform weld bead. Keeping the laser power constant (50 W), with an increase in the scan speed the single- track deposit was noticed to become inconsistent and discontinuous (1000 mm/s), and eventually resulting in fragmentation of tracks (1200 mm/s), commonly referred to as balling [11]. Balling appears spherical in shape (as shown in Fig. 5, 50 W, 1200 mm/s) and bulging upwards which is a result of the dominant surface tension forces of the molten alloy. When such a sets of parameters are applied to fabricate the bulk parts, they may result in a significant amount of porosity [9, 11]. Keeping scan speed constant, and with an increase in the laser power, the single bead deposit shows an increase in width. This increase in the width is due to the higher intensity of the laser beam, which causes a higher volume of melting and results in a wider and deeper melt pool [11] (Fig. 6). In the case of single tracks deposited with a laser power of 100, 150, and 195 W, the bead width was observed to decrease with an increase in scan speed; however, balling phenomenon was not observed at these higher laser power settings.\n\nThe single- track deposits produced on a Ti- 6Al- 4V alloy plate were sectioned and prepared for microstructural\n\n![](images/9e2d4be8dcd27ef09e13cbae0859e5d638aa1adc2e9538e5b160a4359e873cdf.jpg)  \nFig. 5 Cross-section optical micrographs of the single-track deposits produced on a Ti-6Al-4V alloy plate using various parameter combinations\n\n![](images/9938f753186db0ec6e5b9cab603043c8d6846ff0e7e396727181a5ddc181f7c9.jpg)  \nFig. 6 Variation of melt pool geometry on process parameters a bead width, b depth of penetration and c depth-to-width ratio",

The morphology, width, and depth of the single- track deposits can be clearly observed from the optical micrographs. At a power level of  $50~\\mathrm{W}$  and scan speed of  $500~\\mathrm{mm / s}$ , the energy was sufficient to melt the powder and a small portion of the base plate  $(10~\\mu \\mathrm{m})$ . When the scan speed was increased, the depth of the melted region was observed to decrease and eventually resulted in balling, which can be observed for the single track made with  $50~\\mathrm{W}$ ,  $1200~\\mathrm{mm / s}$ . This phenomenon occurs due to the reduction in the energy density as the scan speed was increased according to Eq. 1 [10]. The melt pool depth was observed to increase significantly at lower scan speeds  $(500~\\mathrm{mm / s})$  and higher power levels particularly from  $100~\\mathrm{W}$  (depth:  $45~\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ ) to  $195~\\mathrm{W}$  (depth:  $176~\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ ). The melt pool geometry was observed to have a keyhole shape for the laser power of  $195~\\mathrm{W}$ , whereas for  $100~\\mathrm{W}$  it was bowl shape. This remarkable change in melt pool shape with laser irradiation can be attributed to keyhole versus conduction modes of melting. For lower laser power, melting occurs by locally melting the alloy with heat transfer by conduction and convection inside the melt pool. In the later case, with a laser power of  $195~\\mathrm{W}$ , melting of the alloy occurs by keyhole mode, giving rise to deeper penetration. Keyhole is always associated with vaporization of the alloy and in many cases results in entrapped pores in the melt pool [16].",

These parameters above when used with a well- defined melt pool overlap could provide a window of optimum processing conditions to produce fully dense parts. It is worth noting that the heat affected zone size close to the melt pool also varies with the energy density applied.\n\nThe overall effect of process parameters on the width and depth of the single- track deposits is presented in Fig. 6. Laser power and scan speed have a significant effect on the single- track melt pool geometry. The results in Fig. 6a indicate for all power levels, an increase in scan speed shows a decrease in bead width. An increase in laser power results in an increase in the width, due to the increase in the energy density. The effect of process parameters on the depth of penetration can be observed from Fig. 6b. The results indicate that both laser power and scan speed significantly affect the amount of melting and the depth penetration.

The sample with  $100\\mathrm{W}$  laser power and  $500~\\mathrm{mm / s}$  scan speed resulted in full density, and as the scan speed was increased the porosity in the parts showed a rise due to insufficient melting of the powder.

The sample with  $195\\mathrm{W}$  laser power showed larger pore sizes in the cross- section. The formation of porosity in the deposits could be derived from the keyhole- shaped melt pool that developed while high power parameters were used. High energy density causes the alloy to melt and vaporize in some local regions; since the process is dynamic and quick, the vapors cannot escape fully and become entrapped in the melt pool, resulting in pores (which appear round) in the deposit [16, 19- 22]. However, the pores when formed towards the top of the melt pool are not detrimental because re- melting causes gas to escape out of that layer during subsequent",

    "content": "As described earlier, in SLM material addition takes place due to layer- by- layer melting and solidification of a thin layer of spread powder. In this process, the laser beam also re- melts some portion of the layers beneath to ensure good bonding between the layers. The solidification of the alloy begins with the formation of a  $\\beta$  nucleus, and the preexisting  $\\beta$  grains partially undergo melting and serve as heterogeneous sites for nucleation. Thus, newly formed  $\\beta$  will grow epitaxially in the build direction or opposite to the heat extraction [15, 23]. In close similarity to the weld solidification, the solidifying  $\\beta$  grains tend to orient towards the moving heat source (laser beam), resulting in a slightly tilted grain structure. Further, the  $\\beta$  grain orientation in the deposit highly depends on the laser power, scanning strategy and scan speed applied. They define the amount of time available for the melt to solidify at any particular instance of time [24]. The solidified high- temperature  $\\beta$  (bcc) phase is unstable at lower temperatures and will transform (below  $M_{\\mathrm{s}}$ ) to a metastable phase, martensitic  $\\alpha '$  (hcp) phase by a shear- diffusion less reaction since the cooling rates in SLM are high  $(10^{8} - 10^{5}~\\mathrm{K / s})$  [17]. Hence, the final resultant microstructure will have coarse columnar grains, which are highly oriented towards the build direction with martensite  $\\alpha '$  inside the grains [10, 17, 25]. Due to the inherent layer- by- layer deposition method, as a new layer is being deposited a narrow region (heat affected zone) close to the melt pool boundary will reach temperatures above the transformation temperature  $(990^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})$ , and martensite  $(\\alpha ')$  transforms back to the high- temperature  $\\beta$  phase [12, 17, 25].",

    "content": "# 4 Summary\nThe present work focuses on the evolution of single- track melt pools and porosity in parts made using SLM of alloy Ti- Al6- 4V. The single- track deposits were made using\n\nvarying laser power and scan speeds, and their effects on the melt pool morphology were studied. Microstructural studies on the melt pool cross- section show that at a low power level and high scan speed the width of the track reduces, gradually becomes discontinuous, and eventually results in balling. The depth of penetration of the melt pool was observed to increase with the lower scan speed. At higher power levels, in some cases a keyhole effect was observed.\n\nThe bulk parts produced using parameters similar to single- track deposits showed a direct correlation to the energy density applied and the porosity evolution in the process. Characterization of the cross- sections of the bulk parts demonstrates a good correlation between the single- track melt pool geometry and porosity in the bulk parts. It was learned from this investigation that the process parameters with low energy density and high energy density both result in porosity in the parts, however, due to different reasons. The melt pool information of single- track deposits could be an aid to select a process window determining an optimum set of process parameters. SLM processing parameters with 150 W,  $750~\\mathrm{mm / s}$  and  $195\\mathrm{W}$ ,  $1000~\\mathrm{mm / s}$  and  $1200~\\mathrm{mm / s}$  result in well- defined bowl- shaped melt pools and contribute to near fully dense parts. Therefore, these sets of parameters could be recommended to produce denser parts in the Ti- 6Al- 4V alloy using selective laser melting.",

    "content": "# ABSTRACT\nKeywords:  Additive manufacturing  Defect detection  Physics informed machine learning  Product quality  Supervised learning  Unsupervised learning\n\nAdditive manufacturing facilitates producing of complex parts due to its design freedom in a wide range of applications. Despite considerable advancements in additive manufacturing techniques, 3D- printed parts are still suffering from durability, reproducibility, and reliability. One main reason, which increases the complexity of the problem and causes defects during manufacturing, is the high number of processing parameters. Machine learning approaches seem to be a promising solution to tackle the challenges in the additive manufacturing field. This paper employs a systematic literature review by employing natural language processing and text mining techniques to analyze the recent advancement in the application of machine learning in porosity detection and prediction in 3D- printed parts. Two methods of text analytics are used to evaluate different avenues of research in additive manufacturing. Most frequent machine learning methods employed to evaluate the porosity formed in the 3D- printed parts are introduced and classified based on their applications. Recent advancements in developing hybrid machine learning models reveal the importance of physical domain knowledge (e.g., thermomechanical laws and constraints) in these models and their accuracy. Eventually, challenges and opportunities that exist for the next generation of machine learning techniques in the AM field are identified and summarized.\n\n# 1. Introduction\n",

    "content": "A group of track- by- track followed by layer- by- layer fabrication processes, which is now called additive manufacturing (AM), has had different names during the past 30 years. AM has evolved from rapid prototyping (RP) [1] and rapid tooling [2] methods to a technique employed for end- use parts. AM was also known as solid freeform fabrication (SFF) [3], 3D printing (3DP) [4], and rapid manufacturing (RM) [1]. AM, which was previously limited to prototype fabrication, is now capable of producing end- use metallic products [5]. AM has unique capabilities for building complex and customized one- of- a- kind parts (particularly in the aerospace [6] and biomedical industries [7]) from computer- aided design (CAD) [8] models. Compared to traditional manufacturing techniques, AM\n\nenables fabrication of intricate products with unique microstructure and material properties in a time- efficient and cost- effective way [9].\n\nAM processes can be classified into 7 categories based on ASTM F42 [10]. The articles reviewed here fall into 3 classes of deposition techniques, namely powder bed fusion (PBF), directed energy deposition (DED), and material extrusion, as shown in Fig. 1. In the PBF process, the powder bed uniformly spread over the substrate is selectively melted by a laser or electron beam, which is used as the energy source [11]. In the DED process, the continuous powder stream or wire fed from the deposition nozzle is melted by a focused laser beam to fabricate an object [12]. In the PBF process, the laser speed is approximately one order of magnitude faster than that in DED and the melt pool dimensions are approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that found in the DED process [13]. In the materials extrusion process, the metal powder is mixed with a polymer binder, then the mixture is extruded through the nozzle layer- by- layer to fabricate a part [5,14].",

    "content": "There are many barriers that still restrict the widespread application of metal- based AM as a mainstream manufacturing method. A major challenge in the current additive manufacturing (AM) field is the inconsistency of the printed products (repeatability) [15- 17]. Lack of standardization [18], process reliability, and part quality [19] are also other challenges in the AM field, which require more attention. These issues also affect the performance of the product [20,21]. To identify these technological obstacles and desired capabilities of AM, many recent road mapping efforts have been conducted [22,23]. However, a better understanding of AM manufacturing from design to production is still required.\n\nImproving the reliability and part quality needs a deep understanding of defect formation during manufacturing. In one attempt by Qu et al. [24], nanoparticles were employed to eliminate the large spatters by controlling laser powder bed interaction instabilities. The elimination of large spatters led to a significant reduction of defects in the 3D- printed parts, though multiple pores were observed in the samples printed in their study. Pore formation can have two origins in the AM process. One originated from the powders (gas entrapment in powders) and another one could be originated from the AM processing conditions (oxidation during the AM process, hydrodynamics conditions, including capillary and wetting effects, etc. [25,26]) [27]. These processing conditions could be more than 130 parameters [28], which affect the final quality of the 3D- printed parts and make the design challenging [29]. Carefully designed experiments are one way to evaluate various parameters, (e.g., powder quality, beam power, layer thickness, laser speed, and scan speed) affecting the quality of 3D- printed parts.",

    "content": "One major challenge of AM field that is rich with data is to store and analyze the data. Among all the data- driven methods, machine learning (ML) models seem to be promising to predict and optimize the quality of 3D- printed materials. Recent signs of progress in employing ML to analyze the data in the AM field have been reviewed with a focus on introducing the concept of ML and the potential ML algorithms for solving the existing problems in the AM field [30], investigating shallow and deep learning- based methods for monitoring processing parameters[31], predicting quality of 3D- printed parts using supervised learning [32], summarizing the ML algorithms used for defect detection in the metal laser- based AM process [33], predicting fatigue life and fracture of 3D- printed parts [34], optimizing processing parameters and detecting anomalies, and designing for AM, property prediction and material analytics [35- 38]. A few of these review papers [39] focused on the studies that implemented the laws of physics in developing ML models, but they are not covering a broad application of ML in the AM field. This review paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review to differentiate various ML approaches implemented to analyze the process- dependent material evolution, categorize the datatypes used to develop ML models in the AM field, summarize the studies that constrained their ML models by laws of physics, and discuss the challenges and opportunities in the AM field.",

    "content": "reducing the word into its base form (demmatization) and additional filtering were conducted as the last step of preprocessing to improve the performance of text mining and NLP techniques. To convert text into a digestible form for machine learning, the term frequency- inverse document frequency (TF- IDF) [43] method was employed. TF- IDF is a weighting scheme that assigns higher weights to the words that are not commonly observed in a dataset but are repeated frequently in a few documents. The matrix created using the TF- IDF approach is fed into a K- means clustering algorithm. The number of clusters in the K- means algorithm was chosen based on the within- cluster sum of square (WCSs) and average silhouette score criteria [44]. The WCSs and silhouette calculate the compactness of clusters and the separation of the distance between clusters, respectively. The principal component analysis (PCA) and t- distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t- SNE) were also employed to transform the high- dimensional TF- IDF matrix [43] into two- dimensional representation, and the results of these two transformations are indicated in Fig. 4. The results indicated that PCA performed better than t- SNE regarding visualizing the clusters, as the clusters are not clearly differentiable in t- SNE. The natural language processing analysis indicates that the articles selected to review based on the criteria indicated in Fig. 3 can be classified into three categories, namely the papers employed experimental and physics- based approaches, the papers employed data- driven approaches, and the literature review papers published recently in the AM field. A part of these clusters overlapped, which means that both data- driven and physics- based models were used and discussed in these manuscripts.",

For example, computed tomography (CT scan), a nondestructive evaluation technique, can be used for defect detection, geometric analysis, quantitative comparison, structural quantification, and porosity analysis [47,48]. The majority of these monitoring techniques pay particular attention to the characteristics of the melt pool, as the common defects (i.e., keyhole porosity, lack of fusion, balling), happening during the fabrication in the AM field, have an origin in the dynamics of the melt pool [49- 53]. These fabrication defects affect the structural performance and fracture behavior of the 3D- printed parts, as discussed in a study by Khosravani and Reinicker [54]. In experimental techniques, usually small cubes are built, and the mechanical properties of these cubes are evaluated [55] or material is printed on a single- track basis at different processing conditions [56,57]. Although the experimental approaches are reliable, they are tedious and expensive [37,35]. Physics- based models [58] could also be an alternative, but they are computationally expensive, and their accuracy depends on the assumptions, element type, boundary conditions, and constitutive models (i.e., finite element (FE) models) employed during the simulation [59,60]. They also require many simplifying assumptions, and the large uncertainty of the underlying thermo- physical process makes the models less reliable (i.e., analytical solutions, FE models) [61- 64].",

    "content": "To remedy the issues with experimental and physics- based approaches, data- driven approaches are employed. Data- driven approaches seem to be a suitable alternative, as these methods can predict highly non- linear relationships between a variety of parameters. Traditionally, the design of experiment (DOE) scheme has been used to analyze the processing parameters and optimize the output [65]. However, the DOE approaches require many trials and error efforts to find the zone where the response behavior changes. In the AM field, these trials and error efforts are time- consuming and costly [66,67]. ML models are an attractive alternative data- driven approach to optimize the response based on past data or experience [68]. Due to the high capability of the ML models in predicting highly nonlinear problems, these models have been previously used in many nonlinear problems (e.g., corrosion [69], erosion [70], mechanical properties optimization [71,72]), which are out of the scope of this review paper. ML can improve the quality of 3D- printed parts, optimize processing parameters, and reduce cost. Analyzing data using ML is relatively limited in materials science due to a variety of reasons. Developing an ML model requires a large dataset. The lack of a large dataset is a significant reason, limiting the use of ML [73]. Also, current ML models find statistical correlations between the inputs and output of AM problems at the expense of ignoring physical laws, which makes these models inexplicable. The models generated using this approach do not enlighten how they can make the final decision. For example, the melt pool images are widely used as the inputs in the ML- driven models without understanding the complex laws of nature and the physical relationship between the inputs and response.",

The porosity size and shape formed by each of these phenomena could be different, as depicted in Fig. 8. Microscopic pores are usually formed due to gas entrapment (gas is sometimes trapped and remained inside the vapor cavity, as the vapor cavity is solidified and closed up before the gas can escape) [85], while the size of process- induced pores (i.e., lack- of- fusion porosity [86,87] and shrinkage porosity [88]) varies from sub- microns to macroscopic scales [89].",

    "content": "When laser irradiation strikes the powder and substrate, two melting modes may occur. At low to moderate laser energy intensity, the material is locally melted without clear material vaporization. Conduction is the main mechanism of heat transfer inside the melt pool, which is expressed as conduction mode [83]. Insufficient penetration of the melt pool of a succeeding layer into the substrate or previous layer leads to lack- of- fusion and un- melted powders [90]. This un- melted particle causes high porosities and poor mechanical properties [91]. High melting rates may also cause keyhole porosity [92,25] and lack- of- fusion [27] as depicted in Fig. 9 due to Marangoni convection and recoil pressure [93]. At high laser energy intensity, the material vaporizes on the surface and forms a dense vapor plume, consisting of a cluster of molecules, atoms, ions, and electrons that creates a recoil momentum on the melt pool and forms a cavity [83] in the keyhole mode. In one definition, keyhole mode occurs when power density is higher than  $10^{6}W / cm^{2}$ , otherwise, conduction mode is dominant [94,95]. In another definition, if the aspect ratio of the melt pool is larger than unity, the melting occurs in the keyhole mode otherwise the conduction mode is dominant [96]. It is worth mentioning that the presence of keyhole mode does not necessarily lead to keyhole porosity [92].\n\nThe effects of scan speed and beam power, which determine the dominant melting mode, on the porosity formation were evaluated in a study by Jadhav et al.

    "content": "Pores can also form due to balling effect, resulting in an uneven powder layer [99]. Balling effect depends on the wettability, capillary forces, and surface tension of the melt pool [100]. Balling phenomenon could also occur in high beam powers and scan speeds or in high scan speeds and low beam powers, causing weak bonding to the substrate [101]. Porosity can also be formed between grains and follow the shape of grain boundaries during solidification [102]. Predicting the nonlinear relationship between processing parameters and porosity is very difficult using conventional approaches. Density measurement and image processing methods are two common ways to identify the porosity percentage in a product. Wang et al. [103] recently reviewed the role of porosity defect in the 3D- printed parts, including the defect characterizations, formation and migration mechanisms, and their effects on the quality of 3D- printed parts. To evaluate the porosity percentage in the 3D- printed parts and develop a predictive model, data- driven techniques are employed due to the previously mentioned benefits of these techniques compared to other techniques.\n\n![](images/bfeabdf2915cda38209e502fe4795057ee3a72e37a5a3b4b193577d1887343f1.jpg)  \nFig. 10.

    "content": "One main contributor to dimensional inaccuracies produced by the AM approaches is material shrinkage (MS) [105], which is related to the powder properties and processing parameters [106]. Sintering shrinkage and thermal shrinkage are two common kinds of material shrinkage. The former is generally formed by densification, while the latter is mainly caused by cyclic heating and cooling, leading to significant residual stress and local plastic deformation [107]. To evaluate the material shrinkage, the shrinkage ratio, which is defined as the difference between the desired value and the actual value over the desired value, is employed. When the heated zone starts cooling down, along with changes in the microstructure, the material shrinkage occurs, but this deformation is restrained by the plastic strain formed during the heating step [108] and previously solidified layers underneath [109]. Thus, strong tensile stresses are formed at the interlayer zone [110]. These variations during the cooling step result in a significant deviation from the expected nominal geometry [111]. Zhu et al. [112] attributed the shrinkage of metallic powder to the scan speed and beam power during the SLM process. Wang et al. [113] simulated a multi- layer deposition process to analyze the surface unevenness and excessive build- ups, which always occur in the DED process and reported unstable linear powder feed rate, laser/powder defocusing, accumulated heat, and powder positive defocusing as the reasons of these dimensional inaccuracies in the 3D- printed parts. Raghunath and Pandey [114] used the Taguchi method [115] to design experiments and evaluate the importance of the processing parameters using the analysis of variance [65] between the processing parameters and shrinkage of 12 samples produced using the SLS technology. They concluded that hatch spacing and beam power significantly affect dimensional accuracy.",

These non- uniform internal stresses result in the deformation of 3D- printed products [119]. This materials shrinkage could be controlled by correlating the material shrinkage with the processing parameters [119,120]. Bai et al. [121] evaluated the effect of powder size on the material shrinkage and porosity, as depicted in Fig. 11. They concluded that there is a relationship between material shrinkage and density as indicated in Fig. 11c. It is worth mentioning that the relationship depicted between the powder size and material shrinkage is highly dependent on other processing parameters, which require a large dataset to further investigate.",

    "content": "One significant response parameter in the processing stage, which has been heavily employed to analyze the quality of the 3D- printed parts, is the melt pool dimensions. Melt pools are mainly defined as deposited, remelted, and heat- affected zones[83]. Melt pool geometry is indirect evidence of interactions between the processing parameters and microstructure of the materials (i.e., intrinsic materials properties) [122]. Keyhole formation, balling effect, and lack of fusion can be distinguished based on the melt pool geometry [123]. More importantly, melt pool depth has been measured and analyzed in many studies [124- 126,122], as the melt pool depth is of great interest compared to melt width and length. Melt pool depth reveals if the energy is sufficient to melt through the powder and substrate at a certain beam power and speed [29]. High energy deposition on powder layers causes metals to vaporize [91]. The reaction force of evaporation of liquid metals causes the formation of a vapor cavity in the melted region and causes a deeper melt pool. Several physics- based models have also been developed to predict the melt pool depth and width [127- 131], however, more physical phenomena should be considered in these models to make the model more reliable.",

Melt pool dimensions and shape were also predicted using a coaxial imaging system in a study conducted by Sun et al. [133]. Melt pool dimensions could be used as a key feature to characterize the microstructure and predict the mechanical properties of the parts additively manufactured [50].

The heat- affected zone [134] and the remelted depth are the parameters evaluated to enhance the quality of the 3D- printed parts through improving the material homogeneity [135], degassing and deoxidation [136], and reducing porosity [137]. Small remelted depth may result in incomplete fusion [138], poor metallurgical bonding between the previously solidified layer and the melted powder [139,140], uneven microstructure distribution [141], and poor wetting [142]. On the other hand, large remelted depth causes geometrical inaccuracy in the 3D- printed parts [143] and deteriorated interlayer metallurgical bonding [144].\n\nTo analyze the quality of the 3D- printed parts, many studies tried to find the relationship between the processing parameters and remelted depth. Vastola et al. [145] evaluated the effect of beam size, shape, and scan speed on the size of the remelted pool for an AISI 316L stainless steel. Zhang et al. [146] evaluated the relationship between the remelted depth and linear energy density defined as the beam power over scan speed for Ti6Al4V.

    "content": "Another way to evaluate the microstructure of the AD- fabricated parts is to evaluate the real- time melt pool temperature distribution. Analyzing the heat transfer mechanisms, thermal accumulation, transient temperature distribution, and their relationship helps reduce residual stresses, distortion [147], micro- voids, and cracks formation in 3D- printed parts [148,149]. This thermal distribution in the material is related to scan strategies [150]. A small melt pool at low temperature implies insufficient overlaps between the current melt pool with the next melt pool and lack- of- fusion porosity in the built part [151]. In a melt pool, the cooling rate increases with the increase of the beam power and scan speed [152]. The creation of large thermal gradients is more probable at high cooling rates, which result in an increase of residual stresses, cracking [152], instability, and porosity formation [111,153]. On the other hand, low cooling rates and high temperatures may negatively affect the microstructure refinement and mechanical properties of the 3D- printed parts [152]. The desired uniform operating temperature helps melted material to flow within the melt pool moderately. However, non- uniform temperature gradients and repeated thermal cycles, occurring mainly in the DED process lead to porous and anisotropic microstructures [154] within the 3D- printed parts due to the rapid solidification [155]. This heterogeneous behavior in the microstructure due to the variation in the thermal history affects the mechanical properties, such as fatigue resistance and tensile strength [156]. To homogenize temperature distribution and reduce local heat accumulation, the scanning pattern, one influential parameter on the temperature distribution, needs to be optimized, which leads to minimum distortion [157]. The relationship between the processing parameters and the temperature of the melt pool has been analyzed by Hua et al. [158].",

Acoustic signals acquired during the AM processes are converted into electrical signals, and the signal features are extracted and employed to form clusters used to distinguish different defect mechanisms.\n\nAlso, the spectra emissions produced during the process are collected to extract information about the physics of the problem [164]. When the powder is melted by the laser, a part of the metal is evaporated, which forms plasma above the melt pool. Photons emitted as line emissions have specific wavelengths, and thermal radiation is collected in the spectra. The constitutive elements of the plasma are identified by these wavelengths of the line emissions in the spectra [165] The intensity and shape of spectra indicate the concentration and plasma condition, including the plasma temperature [165], and are directly related to the process parameters and quality of the 3D- printed parts.",

They can be categorized according to the amount and type of supervision required during training [166] into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi- supervised learning, and reinforcement learning [166], as shown in Fig. 13. In supervised learning, the data are labeled, and the data are split into training data and testing data [55]. In unsupervised learning, the data are not labeled, and no training data are required to create the model. In semi- supervised learning, a small part of the datasets are labeled, and then the system learns from these labeled data and classifies a large amount of data. Reinforcement learning, however, is dissimilar from other ML approaches, because this approach uses a reward- and- penalty mechanism to train the algorithm. Favorable actions are rewarded and unfavorable actions are punished, leading to reinforcing good behavior [167]. Reinforced learning (RL) is a suitable approach for real- time metal AM process control in which it is adjusted through machine setting, as RL authorizes goal- seeking sequential decision- making, which was previously used in different AM applications, including controlling melt pool depth and\n\n![](images/dca14e5fbde7bb9ce8d1cbf53542501f1118439075aa25be3783d464a5cba5e9.jpg)  \nFig. 12.

In offline learning, the model is incapable of learning incrementally and must be trained using all available data. The model requires a lot of time and computing resources. When the model is trained and is ready for production, it runs without learning anymore [166]. In online learning, the model can learn incrementally on the fly [166], as shown in Fig. 14. This approach is suitable when one is dealing with an extremely large dataset, which is updated and getting larger with time. Although online monitoring of the live AM process linked with a feedback control adjusting experimental parameters on the fly could be a major research thrust in AM, online learning has not been tested enough in the AM field. Similarly, ML methods can be classified into instance- based and model- based learning [166]. In instance- based models, the model identifies new cases by using a similarity measure, while a model is built and then used to make predictions in model- based learning [166]. The most common machine learning approaches used in the AM field are either offline instance- based or model- based, supervised, or unsupervised learning models, while other machine learning approaches have been less frequently employed in additive manufacturing.

For example, the roadmap of a potential approach [199], which utilizes a combination of a large amount of data collected from a large number of miniature specimens to train a machine learning model for evaluation of fatigue performance of AM parts, is illustrated in Fig. 15. This approach has the capacity of predicting fatigue crack growth of materials, analyzing the cause and effect flow to save time for experiments and simulations by developing ML forward models (PSPP left to right relationship), and optimizing the performance of AM parts by building ML inverse models (PSPP right to left relationship). In the AM processing stage, the input parameters indirectly affect the performance [77]. Depending on the type of the problem in AM, regression, classification, or clustering approach is employed, as indicated in Fig. 13. Tuning processing parameters is difficult [200]. Conventional ML approaches could be a suitable solution to link the processing parameters to the microstructure of the 3D- printed part and its performance. In contrast to experimental techniques, which are only designed and applicable for a particular subject, ML approaches are highly flexible and can be easily applied from one application to another [46]. However, these ML approaches sacrifice the complex physical relationships between the inputs and outputs in the AM field, which encourage practitioners toward developing the next generation of machine learning approaches by considering the laws of physics in the ML model. A recent review paper [39] listed five main ways to integrate physics into ML and develop physics- informed machine learning models (PIML), namely model input, model training, model components, model architecture, and model output.",

With that in mind, direct use of physical parameters (e.g., temperature, beam power, scan speed, etc.) as the inputs to the ML models do not meet the PIML definition and should not be mistakenly considered as a PIML approach. In other words, any ML models with physically meaningful inputs or outputs are not necessarily called physics informed, as ML models should be constrained by the laws of physics to become a PIML model. Although PIMI has been employed in some AM- related studies, other types of PIML methods (i.e., PIMC, PIMO, and PIMA) have been barely used in the AM field. This gap can be addressed by developing more PIMC- , PIMA- , and PIMO- based models and evaluating the accuracy of these models and the data size required to develop such a model in the AM field. This review paper refers interested readers to Ref. [39] for more details regarding these types of PIML methods, and the details are not repeated here. In supervised learning ML algorithms, the data are labeled, and the problems are categorized into classification and regression [166] methods. In the classification method, a model is trained to identify to which category the new data belong (categorical variables), while the regression approach is used to predict the numeric value of a target. Depending on the type of the problem (i.e., classification or regression), a supervised learning model is employed. However, there is no rule, specifying which model performs better in a certain problem, as each of these models may perform differently from one problem to another. The application of these methods in machine learning is discussed in the following sections.",

ML- driven regression models seek to predict the variables of interest by finding statistical correlations between these variables and the input parameters at the expense of the laws of nature. These non- mechanistic ML- driven regression models are not constrained by the laws of physics. They do not require a large computational cost imposed by complex physics, such as the laser- powder interaction, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, laser energy distribution, etc. Also, oversimplified assumptions (e.g., neglecting the heat loss caused by substrate and powder reflection) introduced in the FEM models [58] are not reflected in the ML- driven regression models. More importantly, all physical phenomena that occurred during data gathering are translated to the ML model, which increase the prediction accuracy regardless of throwing light on these laws of nature.\n\nTo improve the accuracy of these ML- driven regression models, the number of input parameters is significant. The more relevant input parameters are entered into the model, the more accurate the model would be. However, covering more input parameters requires a larger dataset, which is hardly obtainable in the AM field. Selecting the most significant input parameters is one way to reduce the data size required for developing an ML- driven regression model, which was employed by Ye et al. [208]. They implemented Spearman's rank correlation [209] to select the most significant input parameters, consisting of the processing parameters (static) with the features extracted from the in- situ melt pool images to develop a semi- dynamic ML model with a small data size to predict the melt pool depth and height as summarized in Fig. 16.",

This benchmark was then used to develop several ML- driven regression and ML- driven classification models to predict the melt pool dimensions and flaw type, respectively, as indicated in Fig. 17.

Using the random forest, logistic regression, and neural network models, they visualized the decision boundaries for the dataset obtained from printing parts using Ti- 6Al- 4 V powder at different power and velocity values. They also used the confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the random forest model for different baseline plus absorptivity coefficients in Fig. 18. Although this large dataset could help cover several input parameters, many other input parameters are still missing, and also a limited range could be covered for each parameter compared to the big picture of AM. Generating a large dataset is not the only issue for developing an ML model, labeling this large dataset is also time- consuming and laborious. To obviate the labeling problem, in- situ data could be labeled using the ex- situ data in some cases, and then in- situ data could be employed to train a supervised machine learning model that can predict the final properties of the 3D- printed part on- the- fly. This approach was tested by Yuan et al. [210] to label in- situ video clips using the ex- situ height map analysis algorithm.

Developing a more comprehensive FEA model validated by experimental data to predict and modify the thermal shrinkage and thermal deformation could be a good continuation of this work.

Employing physics- based models that are iterative in nature (e.g., finite element methods) could be one alternative combined with data- driven ML models to generate PIML models. Employing a finite element model validated by experimental data to predict the temperature field and produce the data required to train an ML model is an example of a physics- informed ML- driven regression model employed by Pham et al. [212] and Fetni et al. [213] for a two- dimensional simulation and Roy et al. [214] for a three- dimensional fused filament fabrication (FFF) simulation indicated in Fig. 19.

It is worth mentioning that laws of physics are employed in the PIML models to cover the missing information, which cannot be captured using experiments, and experiments are employed along with laws of physics to justify and cover the assumptions that simplify the physics- informed models (e.g., constant thermophysical properties, sophisticated effects of microstructure, etc.).

This point was clearly indicated in a study by Ren and Wang [217] by developing Gaussian process regression models to predict the melt pool volume using a simulated dataset, an experimental dataset, and a mix of the simulated and experimental datasets. They indicated that the melt pool volume suddenly had a large overshoot due to heat accumulation as depicted in Fig. 20. This large melt pool overshoot was controlled by significantly reducing the laser power of the second and the subsequent tracks. Then, the physics- informed Gaussian process regression model was used to predict this dynamic evolution of the melt pool, as depicted in Fig. 20. It was also found that the model performance can be improved by mixing the numerical and experimental datasets when the experimental data size is not large enough, as the high- fidelity simulated dataset, even though subject to errors, at least can catch the trend of the real- time experimental data. This helps achieve a PIML model with a limited number of experimental data, which could be employed to accurately predict the melt pool size.\n\nTo reduce the dependency on a large number of datasets, Zhu et al. [218] introduced a PIMT model, a physics- informed neural network (PINN) model, that incorporates both data and fundamental principles of physics (i.e., continuity, momentum, and energy governing equations) into a deep neural network to inform the training processes. To do this, the loss function used in conventional deep neural networks to measure the model performance against ground truth values was modified by these laws of physics, which were often expressed as a set of PDEs with appropriate initial and boundary conditions, and was penalized by the residuals of the",

As depicted in Fig. 23, a similar approach was taken in a study by Seifi et al. [223] to detect the thermal- defect relationship in real- time manufacturing, as there is a direct relationship between the thermal history of the 3D- printed part and its microstructure. To identify this relationship, the highly dynamic thermophysical AM process captured by a pyrometer camera during manufacturing was characterized by developing a tensor- based modeling approach. The key layerwise signature features were extracted from the melt pool images by multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) and these features were employed to predict the overall quality of the deposited layers using an SVM classifier.",

The results showed the high potential capability of acoustic emission for assessing the overall deposition quality and identifying defects, as indicated in Fig. 24. Although the models developed in Gaja et al. study [224] revealed a promising accuracy in detecting defects, their model should be further extended to cover other types of defects, such as balling, lack- of- fusion, etc. To do this, the LR model employed by Gaja et al. [224] may not be capable to be used in non- binary classification tasks with more than two labels. Thus, this model is not suggested for classification problems. CNN model could be a proper alternative employed in a study by Shevchik et al.

[16] developed an ML framework to establish a relationship between the melt pool morphological characteristics and defects in the microstructure, as indicated in Fig. 26. They employed thermal images to find the melt pool profile and functional principal component analysis to extract the critical features of the melt pools, which are responsible for the majority of the variations in the melt pool. They then used this information to train different ML models (i.e., KNN, SVM, DT, DA), predict defects in the AM parts, and compare the accuracy of these models using the highest rate of accurately classifying melt pools  $(M_{1})$  and lowest rate for incorrectly identifying normal melt pools as pores  $(M_{2})$  as listed in Table 2. Similarly, the type and severity of porosity have been linked to physically intuitive process signatures (i.e., melt pool length, temperature gradient, and ejecta or spatter characteristics), which were extracted from melt pool images, using relatively simple ML models (KNN, LR, and SVM) in a study by Smoqi et al. [229]. The accuracy of these models was then compared with a more complex ML model (i.e., CNN), which directly used raw melt pool images. This procedure was indicated in Fig. 27.

The ML models developed earlier for classification problems are well known for their exemplary performance to learn complex process- property correlations. However, these models are limited to machine settings and ignore the physical laws of the problem. If the machine, components, or range of processing parameters change, the dominant laws of physics may change due to these changes, and consequently, these models fail. In classification problems, developing PIML models is an appropriate solution to obviate such a problem using ML models, which are employed more often in recent publications. In a study by Liu et al. [237], porosity sizes categorized into three levels (i.e., pass, flag, and fail) were correlated with the laser- related physical effects instead of machine setting parameters using six different ML models. The accuracy of the PIML model developed in their study was compared with the accuracy of an ML model that directly used machine setting parameters. They concluded that the ML model developed using the machine setting parameters has nearly the same performance as the PIML model, as depicted in Fig. 30. However, the PIML model does not rely on the machine setting and can be applied to predict quality in different machines and settings.\n\nMechanistic input parameters predicting balling defect [238,239] using 6 out of 10 most important processing parameters and material properties is a good example of the PIML model employed by Du et al.

    "content": "In addition to the resource- intensive nature of conventional ML models, the latency of detection and poor generalizability are common drawbacks of applying these models in the AM field [242- 244]. The data recorded continuously using heterogeneous sensors need to be transferred to a data analysis procedure, which causes an inherent latency during data analysis. Also, data- driven approaches developed using simple geometries (e.g., cubes and cylinders) may not be generalizable to complex, practical AM parts. One way to resolve these issues in the classification problem is to employ a PIML approach. A PIML model was developed by twinning in- situ melt pool temperature measurements with a mechanistic- based thermal model, predicting the thermal history of the part updated layer- by- layer to detect flaw formation in a study conducted by Yavari et al. [245]. Facilitating precise and interpretable detection of flaws and obviating the need of transferring sensor signatures to a separate data analysis algorithm, which leads to precluding the inherent latency in data- driven flaw detection, are the key outcome of employing the PIML model.\n\nAnother significant research thrust in AM is to develop online ML methods for in- situ monitoring of the AM processes and link these data to a feedback control system that adjusts experimental parameters on the fly. Developing models capturing the complexity of AM processes is now achievable through the use of high- performance computers.

    "content": "One of the significant challenges in the AM processes is the lack of a systematic classification of defects, effective characterization of process conditions during manufacturing, and the unavailability of an appropriate approach to link the variations in the processing parameters to these defects [262]. One way to evaluate the quality of the 3D- printed parts is to obtain acoustic emissions during manufacturing. In one attempt [263], the acoustic emission was recorded during layer- by- layer material deposition and the silhouette value [264] was calculated for different numbers of clusters. It was found that the largest silhouette value can be obtained if the number of clusters is set to two, which indicates two classes of defects (i.e., porosity and crack) exist in the data. Then, the KMC algorithm, which aims to minimize the distances between all the vectors of a cluster and its center and maximize the distance between the centers of the clusters, was employed to analyze the AE signals and predict the defect type, as indicated in a flowchart in Fig. 33. More defect patterns were included in a model developed by Ye et al. [248] by gathering the acoustic signals from different defect patterns (i.e., balling, slight balling, normal, slight overheating, and overheating) formed during manufacturing at various energy densities. The relationship and hierarchical information of the raw acoustic signals were extracted using this approach with no need for preprocessing and feature extraction from the signals. Taheri et al. [265] analyzed the relationship between the process conditions (i.e., normal, low powder, and powder spray process conditions) and the acoustic emissions through in- situ monitoring of the DED process and classification of acoustic emission data using KMC. Although the model can fairly accurately correlate the processing",

Different behavior of acoustic patterns due to the complexity of thermal behavior could be one reason for low classification accuracy at low beam power.\n\nThe inputs used in the clustering approaches could also be in the form of spectra emissions, linking the process parameters to the quality of the 3D- printed parts. The intensity and shape of spectra emissions indicate the concentration and plasma condition are directly related to the process parameters and the quality of 3D- printed parts. For instance, the spectra emissions were collected during the manufacturing process for the parts printed at varying laser power, scan speed, and power delivery rate, and the spectra features were extracted using an LSTM- autoencoder. These features were then employed to classify the quality of the part based on the processing parameters using a KMC model [247].\n\nOne of the most popular data types used to train and develop an unsupervised ML model is optical measurements, which have been employed to collect the temperature field, image of the powder bed, and molten pool in the AM process [266,267]. The authors [248] previously developed a DBN model to detect defect type through acoustic signals and applied the same approach in another study [249] to correlate the plume and spatter near- infrared (NIR) images obtained during manufacturing with the melted state and energy density. The accuracy of the model developed using acoustic emission data in ref. [248] was reported higher than the accuracy of the model developed using the NIR images reported in ref. [249].",

[270] to classify the quality of the 3D- printed parts produced at different processing parameters. To do this, a large number of optical images were segmented and fed into a CAE model and were clustered based on the best gap value technique using a so- called gap statistic method [271]. The clusters were manually scored to represent the lowest to the highest quality, and then these results were applied to the original images to optimize the processing parameters. Although the model indicated the potential of scoring the quality of the part and the traditional parameter optimization, disparities exist between the ML model and the traditional optimization process. This disparity could be due to the limited diversity in the data employed in the image classification.\n\nA rapid pore classification KMC model was developed using two different sources of data, namely 3D pore data collected using the XCT technique and 2D pore data collected using the optical microscopy technique by Snell [272].

    "content": "suitable to analyze the 2D pore data. Although a fair starting point for 2D pore data clustering was established, more information is needed to reliably classify the data. KMC was found suitable more for analyzing 3D pores (i.e., lack- of- fusion and keyhole pores), as 3D pore data provided more information than 2D pores. KMC was also employed to automatically detect defect onset and spatially identify defects during the in- situ SLM process by identifying the molten areas with different behavior from other sections of the same layer [273]. The proposed approach considered the defects formed due to overheating and could be further extended by considering other defect scenarios. SOM, a neural network- based model (Fig. 34), was employed in a study by Gracia- Moreno [274] to develop an automatic porosity classification method based on the size, distribution, and origin of pores. Porosity formation was also predicted by Khanzadeh et al. [275,62] in the parts using the thermal profile of the melt pools. The authors basically identified pores from thermal profile images by categorizing melt pools into normal and porosity (abnormal) clusters. Porosity cluster includes the melt pools with low or high temperature and irregular shapes, as indicated in Fig. 35. They also compared the results with their previous study [276] considering morphological features of melt pools (e.g., length, width, area, etc.). They concluded that SOM clustering based on morphological features fails to properly distinguish different clusters. This means that the basic features of melt pools may not be sufficient for the identification of defects, and this detection could be performed better by considering the thermal distribution of melt pools as input. Although the authors utilized SOM to differentiate melt pool morphologies, the descriptor of the melt pool shape chosen in their studies was neither scale invariant nor capable of including spatter or vapor plume information.",

    "content": " This gap was addressed in a study by Scime and Beuth [49] by incorporating the information about the shape of the melt pool, spatter, and vapor plume to improve the difference between in- situ morphologies. The authors combined the morphology of the melt pools previously collected by the authors [96] with fundamental knowledge of the space process [277]. The space process was analyzed using contemporary computer vision (CV) feature extraction methods [278], which were used to classify anomalies (i.e., recoater streaking, recoater hopping, debris, super- elevation, part failure, incomplete spreading) at the powder spreading [279] and powder characterization [280] stages. Scale Invariant Feature Transforms (SIFT) [281] and Bag- of- Words [192] unsupervised ML techniques linked these data to processing defects previously reported by the authors in ref. [96] using a multi- class SVM model. A flowchart of this methodology is shown in Fig. 36. Several other studies [282,283] evaluated the effect of temperature on the relative density and revealed a relationship between single melt pool events and defect formation. However, little to no studies monitored melt pools over multiple slices, revealing hidden patterns in noisy data. A recent study by Voigt et al. [284] employed photodiode on- axis signal to monitor melt pool condition over multiple slices and concluded density enhancement of the melt pool signal at the edges. This observation, which was obtained by clustering time- series sequences into three classes using unsupervised machine learning revealed that melt pool condition changes particularly close to the edges during the manufacturing of a slice.",

However, laws of physics, for example, can contribute to developing dimensionless numbers that could be used as the input of an ML model predicting acoustic signals. Also, image- based data can also be generated using laws of physics and fed into PIMI models. Working toward developing image- based data with the aid of laws of physics and employing these data to develop unsupervised PIML models could be a promising avenue of research.

    "content": "Despite the great practical value of semi- supervised ML models, These models have been less frequently used in the AM field. In the AM field, it is difficult to collect labeled data, though it is relatively easy to gather unlabeled data. The models developed using the semi- supervised ML approach have mostly been used in defect detection problems. To evaluate the quality of an AM part, a Gaussian mixture model was developed to automatically detect faults in the AM products in a study by Okaro et al. [250]. In their work, a large photodiode dataset was developed to extract key features. The monitoring system set up in their work includes in- situ monitoring and ex- situ labeling methods. To label the ex- situ data as faulty or acceptable, ultimate tensile strength tests were conducted. It was found that the semi- supervised model developed in this study can capture the benchmark results more closely than those obtained using the supervised approach as depicted in Fig. 37. A combination of supervised and unsupervised ML models (i.e., KNN) was also employed as a semi- supervised ML model to classify the printed layers into either drift (hotspot in the layer) or no drift (no hot spot in the layer) in a study by Yadav et al. [289]. Larsen et al. [290] modeled the laser dynamics of the SLM process directly from high- speed images, and the model was tested on various porosity levels and successfully differentiated the optimal processing and defective materials. Semi- supervised CNN was also employed to categorize the quality of the parts into under- melt, beautiful- weld, and over- melt in a study conducted by Li et al. [291]. The model revealed a promising performance using limited low- quality (i.e., noisy and blurred images) labeled data.",

No rule exists regarding the number of labeled data required to train a semi- supervised model. Different labeled data sizes were chosen to evaluate the effect of the number of labeled data on the performance of the semi- supervised model. They reported that the semi- supervised CNN model outperformed the fully supervised method in both regression and classification problems. Comparing the results obtained using the semi- supervised method with the same results obtained using an unsupervised CNN model could be a great continuation of this work to further evaluate the semi- supervised performance.

Deep learning was also combined with reinforced learning to create a subset of deep reinforced learning (DRL) employed in a study by Ogoke and Farimani [168] to generate a control policy for managing the melt pool depth by controlling either the scan speed or power of the laser during the melting process. In the traditional 3D- printed cases where the processing parameters (e.  $\\mathbf{g}_{\\cdot}$  scan speed) are kept unchanged throughout the entire trajectory, the melt pool noticeably becomes deeper at the locations at which the laser changes its direction. The growth in the melt pool dept at the spots where the laser changes its direction is due to heat accumulation. With the aid of DRL, the learned control policy is capable of achieving a considerably smaller melt pool depth variation than the constant process parameter scenario. The model proposed in the study by Ogoke and Farimini [168] was developed based on the numerical data and could be further extended using experimental data with necessary modifications. For example, due to the lag time between the order and execution of an action, controlling the scan speed might be difficult, particularly at high scan speeds. Also, some modifications in the printing process are required to change the processing parameters during manufacturing.

Standardization\nOne main challenge of the application of ML in the AM field is the lack of standardization, which hinders the real- world adaptation of ML in the prediction of the quality of the 3D- printed part. No comprehensive and accessible database, which includes different materials and printing processes, exists. Also, despite employing numerous criteria to evaluate the quality of 3D- printed parts, no specific measuring criteria have been defined to judge the quality of the 3D- printed parts. Due to a lack of standardization, the majority of studies reviewed earlier focused on the detection of defects rather than the detection and evaluation of the impact of defects. Developing binary defect classification ML models may help get a rough idea regarding the presence of defects and the quality of 3D- printed parts. However, defects need to be classified into more categories from negligible to severe defects. Developing such an ML model might be more challenging due to a lack of standardization and dataset size.",

Compared to many ML models developed in the AM field, very few PIML models have been developed. The physics- informed ML models become more and more essential for overcoming these challenges. By incorporating the laws of physics into the model, the model variability can be minimized. The physics used in the PIML model could help develop models with a smaller dataset and more input parameters with a wider range [296]. Although physics- based models may not accurately predict the output due to many assumptions, simplifications, and approximations considered to develop the models, these models are still able to shed the light on the hidden knowledge of the AM problems. Also, finding the physical relationships between different parameters could be used within the PIML model. The processing parameters, for example, can turn into a set of dimensionless numbers, which describe the physics of the problem. When the physics of the problem is understood, the validity of these dimensionless numbers can be derived in a certain range, which makes the model valid beyond the range of the processing parameters employed to generate the dataset. This means that the ML model developed using this technique incorporates a higher number and a wider range of processing parameters with a smaller dataset size. More importantly, the PIML models have been mainly developed in the AM field, as PIML is the most convenient type of PIML model among all models introduced. Developing a different type of PIML (e.g., PIMT, PIMA, and PIMO) other than PIML or even developing PIML models using more than one definition of PIML model is an underdeveloped and underexplored research area, which could be investigated.",

Hybrid algorithms need to be developed with the ability to handle more than one type of data.

During the manufacturing of 3D- printed parts, a part of the data could be captured using in- situ monitoring techniques. The ML models developed in the AM field are mainly based on offline machine learning techniques, and this real- time data cannot be used in this type of ML model. With offline ML models, the chance of training and modifying the quality of the part during manufacturing is missing. However, the real- time data could be used to develop online ML models. Less effort is required to capture the data during manufacturing and also more data could be obtained with much less labor job. Due to these benefits of online learning, it is expected that more online learning models are employed for future studies in the AM field.\n\nAlso, one laborious task of collecting and preparing data for analysis is to label the data. Employing supervised techniques requires labeled data, and unsupervised techniques are not as accurate as supervised techniques.

Among these PIML models, PIMT, PIMC, PIMA, and PIMO models have been left underexplored in detecting defects and analyzing the quality of 3D- printed parts, while more attention needs to be paid to PIMI models.
